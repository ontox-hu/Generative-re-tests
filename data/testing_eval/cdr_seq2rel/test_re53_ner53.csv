"Famotidine-associated delirium. A series of six cases. Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost. Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium, only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine. The authors report on six cases of famotidine-associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine. The pharmacokinetics of famotidine are reviewed, with no change in its metabolism in the elderly population seen. The implications of using famotidine in elderly persons are discussed.",famotidine @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@,famotidine @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Indomethacin induced hypotension in sodium and volume depleted rats. After a single oral dose of 4 mg/kg indomethacin (IDM) to sodium and volume depleted rats plasma renin activity (PRA) and systolic blood pressure fell significantly within four hours. In sodium repleted animals indomethacin did not change systolic blood pressure (BP) although plasma renin activity was decreased. Thus, indomethacin by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin-angiotensin system in sodium and volume depletion.",indomethacin ; idm @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@,indomethacin ; idm @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Late-onset scleroderma renal crisis induced by tacrolimus and prednisolone: a case report. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) but can be severe enough to require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy. Moderate to high dose corticosteroid use is recognized as a major risk factor for SRC. Furthermore, there have been reports of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine in patients with SSc. In this article, we report a patient with SRC induced by tacrolimus and corticosteroids. The aim of this work is to call attention to the risk of tacrolimus use in patients with SSc.",tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ systemic sclerosis ; ssc @DISEASE@ @CID@ corticosteroid ; corticosteroids @CHEMICAL@ systemic sclerosis ; ssc @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic microangiopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@,tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ systemic sclerosis ; ssc @DISEASE@ @CID@ corticosteroid ; corticosteroids @CHEMICAL@ systemic sclerosis ; ssc @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic microangiopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine-dependent patients in Malaysia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine-induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and methamphetamine-induced psychosis was also studied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia. Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records. RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms. Co-morbid major depressive disorder (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors. Major depressive disorder (OR=2.870, CI=1.154-7.142) and antisocial personality disorder (OR=3.299, 95 CI=1.375-7.914) were the only factors associated with current psychosis. CONCLUSION: There was a high risk of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. It was associated with co-morbid affective disorder, antisocial personality, and heavy methamphetamine use. It is recommended that all cases of methamphetamine dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms.",methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ psychosis ; psychotic symptoms @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ bipolar disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ antisocial personality disorder ; antisocial personality @DISEASE@ @CID@,methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ psychosis ; psychotic symptoms @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ bipolar disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ antisocial personality disorder ; antisocial personality @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson's disease: clues from dyskinetic patients. The plasticity of primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is severely impaired. We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS). This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation. This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity. The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known. To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1. These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinetic ; dyskinesias ; lids ; abnormal involuntary movements @DISEASE@ @CID@,levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinetic ; dyskinesias ; lids ; abnormal involuntary movements @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The function of P2X3 receptor and NK1 receptor antagonists on cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis in rats. METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.9% saline (4 ml/kg); the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with CYP (150 mg/kg); and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with CYP with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, Suramin and GR 82334. Spontaneous pain behaviors following the administration of CYP were observed. Urodynamic parameters, bladder pressure-volume curve, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), were recorded. Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide treatment increased the spontaneous pain behaviors scores. The incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group (X(2) = 7.619, P = 0.007) and control group (X(2) = 13.755, P = 0.000). MCC in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups (P < 0.01). Histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats' bladder included edema, vasodilation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In model group, the expression of P2X3 receptor increased in urothelium and suburothelium, and NK1 receptor increased in suburothelium, while the expression of them in intervention group was lower. CONCLUSIONS: In CYP-induced cystitis, the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors increased in urothelium and/or suburothelium. Perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists ameliorated the bladder function.",cyclophosphamide ; cyp @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide ; cyp @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide ; cyp @CHEMICAL@ edema @DISEASE@ @CID@,NOTcyclophosphamideNOT ; NOTcypNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTcystitisNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@ NOTcyclophosphamideNOT ; NOTcypNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTpainNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@ NOTcyclophosphamideNOT ; NOTcypNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTedemaNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute hepatitis associated with clopidogrel: a case report and review of the literature. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a common cause of acute hepatitis, and the recognition of the responsible drug may be difficult. We describe a case of clopidogrel-related acute hepatitis. The diagnosis is strongly suggested by an accurate medical history and liver biopsy. Reports about cases of hepatotoxicity due to clopidogrel are increasing in the last few years, after the increased use of this drug. In conclusion, we believe that physicians should carefully consider the risk of drug-induced hepatic injury when clopidogrel is prescribed.",clopidogrel @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis ; hepatotoxicity ; hepatic injury @DISEASE@ @CID@,NOTclopidogrelNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOThepatitisNOT ; NOThepatotoxicityNOT ; NOThepatic injuryNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Bortezomib and dexamethasone as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: analysis of long-term clinical outcomes. Bortezomib (bort)-dexamethasone (dex) is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). This retrospective study investigated the combination of bort (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks) and dex (20 mg on the day of and the day after bort) as salvage treatment in 85 patients with R/R MM after prior autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had received immunomodulatory drugs included in some line of therapy before bort-dex. The median number of bort-dex cycles was 6, up to a maximum of 12 cycles. On an intention-to-treat basis, 55 % of the patients achieved at least partial response, including 19 % CR and 35 % achieved at least very good partial response. Median durations of response, time to next therapy and treatment-free interval were 8, 11.2, and 5.1 months, respectively. The most relevant adverse event was peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in 78 % of the patients (grade II, 38 %; grade III, 21 %) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6 %. With a median follow up of 22 months, median time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.9, 8.7, and 22 months, respectively. Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving bort-dex a single line of prior therapy. Bort-dex was an effective salvage treatment for MM patients, particularly for those in first relapse.",bortezomib ; bort @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone ; dex @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@,NOTbortezomibNOT ; NOTbortNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTperipheral neuropathyNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@ NOTdexamethasoneNOT ; NOTdexNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTperipheral neuropathyNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pubertal exposure to Bisphenol A increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice. The negative effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior. This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following BPA exposure during puberty. On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg BPA/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test. In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to BPA. AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with BPA compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our findings showed that pubertal BPA exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced anxiety-like behaviors.",bisphenol a ; bpa @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@,NOTbisphenolNOT a ; NOTbpaNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTanxietyNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@,NOTisoproterenolNOT @CHEMICAL@ NOTcardiotoxicityNOT @DISEASE@ @CID@
