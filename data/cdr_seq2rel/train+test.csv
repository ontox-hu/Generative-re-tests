"Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine. In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.",alpha-methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Lidocaine-induced cardiac asystole. Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers.

The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded. Six additional patients received a 30-mg i.v. bolus dose. Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score. The times to first fasciculation, twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates.

"Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium-induced chronic renal failure in rats. Rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",lithium ; li @CHEMICAL@ chronic renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium ; li @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium ; li @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Treatment of Crohn's disease with fusidic acid: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin. Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight Crohn's disease patients were included. Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.",fusidic acid @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity. Moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy, sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits. Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type. Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels. The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine.

"Myasthenia gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administration. We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia. The serum magnesium concentration was 3.0 mEq/L, which is usually well tolerated. The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days. While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade. After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated. Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission.",magnesium @CHEMICAL@ myasthenia gravis @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine: an identical site? Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. Subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. No early onset migraine was observed. Thus the migraine-inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis. This is not consistent with a CNS origin of migraine attack.",nitroglycerin @CHEMICAL@ migraine @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clotiazepam-induced acute hepatitis. We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis, 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam, a thienodiazepine derivative.

"Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment. Two of 14 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension. In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. In patient 1, plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol were elevated. In patient 2, in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels, plasma aldosterone values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels.

"Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (Captopril) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat. Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man. Injection of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone. It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin). Captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.",tranexamic acid ; amca @CHEMICAL@ intravascular coagulation @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat: efficacy, toxicity, and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations. Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a commonly used AED, has been implicated in some clinical studies. A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.",hexafluorodiethyl ether ; hfde @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs. In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin. The release rate of epinephrine (control, 6.7 +/- 0.6 ng/kg/min) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 +/- 5% of control (p less than 0.001) during 0.1 microgram/kg/min and to 63 +/- 5% (0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05) or 95 +/- 13% (not significant) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram/kg/min.

"Death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease. Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of choriocarcinoma. Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",etoposide @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary obstruction @DISEASE@ @CID@ methotrexate @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary obstruction @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary obstruction @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Dapsone-associated Heinz body hemolytic anemia in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait. A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait (AE) and leprosy developed a Heinz body hemolytic anemia while taking a dose of dapsone (50 mg/day) not usually associated with clinical hemolysis. Her red blood cells (RBCs) had increased incubated Heinz body formation, decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), and decreased GSH stability. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs. Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated Heinz body formation, the GSH content and GSH stability were normal. The pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non-dapsone-exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs. Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose in hematologically normal individuals.

"Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol, propafenone, diltiazem, and sparteine. A 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III. AV block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone.

"On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats. The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats. Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ muscular rigidity ; rigidity @DISEASE@ @CID@ morphine @CHEMICAL@ akinetic @DISEASE@ @CID@ morphine @CHEMICAL@ hyperkinetic @DISEASE@ @CID@ haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ muscular rigidity ; rigidity @DISEASE@ @CID@

Calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin D3 about 32 days prepartum (8.8 mg/100 ml) than in control cows (5.5 mg/100 ml). None of the cows treated with vitamin D3 showed signs of milk fever during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of milk fever during this period. Signs of vitamin D3 toxicity were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin D3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows died. There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died. Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever, we concluded that vitamin D3 cannot be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum.",vitamin d3 @CHEMICAL@ hypercalcemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ vitamin d3 @CHEMICAL@ hyperphosphatemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Diseases of peripheral nerves as seen in the Nigerian African. The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders, as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented. There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade. Sensori-motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation (50%). Guillain-Barr   syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-motor neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy. Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug-induced neuropathy. Migraine (20%) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%). In 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined. Heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare.

"A double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of dothiepin hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients. Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness, and both were significantly superior to placebo. The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred vision, dry mouth, and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline. Dothiepin also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects. There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters. Dothiepin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients.",amitriptyline @CHEMICAL@ blurred vision @DISEASE@ @CID@ amitriptyline @CHEMICAL@ dry mouth @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Behavioral effects of diazepam and propranolol in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. The effects of oral doses of diazepam (single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks) and propranolol (single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg/day for 2 weeks) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design. Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol. Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ. Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients tested 5-8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance. These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects.

"Effect of aspirin on N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide-induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat. The co-administration of aspirin with N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (FANFT) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT-induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors. An autoradiographic study was performed on male F-344 rats fed diet containing FANFT at a level of 0.2% and/or aspirin at a level of 0.5% to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by FANFT in the forestomach and bladder. FANFT-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks. In the forestomach, and also in the liver, aspirin did not affect the FANFT-induced increase in labeling index. The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin's effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation. Also, there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin.",n-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide ; fanft @CHEMICAL@ bladder carcinomas @DISEASE@ @CID@ n-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide ; fanft @CHEMICAL@ forestomach tumors @DISEASE@ @CID@

The effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects, 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy, whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuropathy. It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients, particularly those with autonomic neuropathy.",nitroglycerin @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Characterization of estrogen-induced adenohypophyseal tumors in the Fischer 344 rat. Pituitary tumors were induced in F344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethylstilbestrol (DES, 8-10 mg) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules. Over a range of 1-150 days of DES treatment, pairs of control and DES-treated rats were sacrificed, and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single-cell preparations. The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight, intracellular prolactin (PRL) content and subsequent release in primary culture, immunocytochemical PRL staining, density and/or size alterations via separation on Ficoll-Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation, and cell cycle analysis, after acriflavine DNA staining, by laser flow cytometry. Total cell yields from DES-treated pituitaries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58.9 times control values by day 150. Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels, and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls, after at least 8 days of DES exposure. Beyond 8 days of DES exposure, the immunochemically PRL-positive proportion of cells increased to over 50% of the total population. Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols. All these effects of DES were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals.

"Metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin-treated cells. The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged. Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase. The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool. In the adriamycin-treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.",adriamycin @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity ; cardiotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Time course of lipid peroxidation in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephropathy. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephropathy, with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria. The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this study. Rats were treated with a single IV injection of puromycin aminonucleoside, (PAN, 7.5 mg/kg) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,5,7,10,17,27,41 (N = 5-10 per group). The kidneys were removed, flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer. Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates. Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Proteinuria was evident at day 5, peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27. Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17.

"Clomipramine-induced sleep disturbance does not impair its prolactin-releasing action. The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance, induced by clomipramine administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect. Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo-controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping (n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake (n = 6). Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomipramine given orally 2 hours before blood collection. Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure. For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values. During the night clomipramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness. As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies (46 +/- 19% vs 34 +/- 10%), it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se. The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomipramine ingestion.",clomipramine @CHEMICAL@ sleep disturbance @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Effect of coniine on the developing chick embryo. Coniine, an alkaloid from Conium maculatum (poison hemlock), has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock. The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis, presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade. However, coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick. Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 3%, and 6% and 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose-dependent manner. All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0.75%. The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes. No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate-treated chicks. There was a statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound. Control chicks were in motion an average of 33.67% of the time, while coniine-treated chicks were only moving 8.95% of a 5-min interval, and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks. In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine-induced arthrogryposis.

"Epidural blood flow during prostaglandin E1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension. To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or trimethaphan (TMP) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. An initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of PGE1 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of TMP (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at about 60 mmHg. The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. After starting PGE1 or TMP, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. Heart rate (HR) did not change in either group. EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group, EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05)).

Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (NF) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, NF-M and NF-H, was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions.

"Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations. Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only).

In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition. In the vitro human platelet aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently. In addition, neither TET nor FAN showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) using human-citrated plasma.

"Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin. Oncopaz Cooperative Group. BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.",gemcitabine ; gem @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ gemcitabine ; gem @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ gemcitabine ; gem @CHEMICAL@ neurotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinorelbine ; vnb @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinorelbine ; vnb @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinorelbine ; vnb @CHEMICAL@ neurotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Warfarin-induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D. The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.",warfarin @CHEMICAL@ artery calcification ; calcification of the artery @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antidepressant-induced mania in bipolar patients: identification of risk factors. BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression. METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale. Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV bipolar I vs. bipolar II), number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), use and type of mood stabilizers (lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes. Sex, age, diagnosis (bipolar I vs. bipolar II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching. The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer. In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium (15%, 4/26) than in patients not treated with lithium (44%, 8/18; p = .04). The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008). CONCLUSION: The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches.",antidepressant ; antidepressants @CHEMICAL@ mania ; bipolar ; bipolar depression ; bipolar disorder ; manic ; hypomanic ; dsm-iv bipolar i ; bipolar ii ; hypomania ; bipolar i @DISEASE@ @CID@ serotonin reuptake inhibitors ; ssris @CHEMICAL@ mania ; bipolar ; bipolar depression ; bipolar disorder ; manic ; hypomanic ; dsm-iv bipolar i ; bipolar ii ; hypomania ; bipolar i @DISEASE@ @CID@

Sedation has been commonly used in the neonate to decrease the stress and pain from the noxious stimuli and invasive procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as to facilitate synchrony between ventilator and spontaneous breaths. Fentanyl, an opioid analgesic, is frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit setting for these very purposes. Various reported side effects of fentanyl administration include chest wall rigidity, hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia.

"Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM) and in elevated plasma lactate (LA) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice.",zidovudine @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy ; cm @DISEASE@ @CID@ lamivudine @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy ; cm @DISEASE@ @CID@ indinavir @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy ; cm @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: An association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction has been found in some, but not all, studies. We investigated this association, according to the type of progestagen included in third-generation (i.e., desogestrel or gestodene) and second-generation (i.e., levonorgestrel) oral contraceptives, the dose of estrogen, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence. Subjects supplied information on oral-contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors. An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). The adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.1) among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives and 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.5) among those who used third-generation oral contraceptives. Among women who used oral contraceptives, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives. The results with respect to the use of third-generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second-generation oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation.",oral contraceptives ; oral-contraceptive ; oral contraceptive @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats. The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats. Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core, and then were locally injected with GR 55562 (an antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors) or CP 93129 (an agonist of 5-HT1B receptors). Given alone to any accumbal subregion, GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg/side) or CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg/side) did not change basal locomotor activity. Systemic cocaine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats. GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to cocaine, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core. When injected into the accumbens shell (but not the core) before cocaine, CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg/side) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg/side of the agonist. The later enhancement was attenuated after intra-accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 (1 microg/side). Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (GR 55562) and agonist (CP 93129), respectively. In other words, the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5-HT1B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ locomotor hyperactivity ; hyperlocomotion @DISEASE@ @CID@ cp 93129 @CHEMICAL@ locomotor hyperactivity ; hyperlocomotion @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis, investigate its mechanism, and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases. CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period. T-cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls. DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature. Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine. The mechanisms of this ticlopidine-induced cholestasis are unclear. Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug's hepatotoxicity, as suggested by the T-cell stimulation study reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated. Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts. This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.",ticlopidine @CHEMICAL@ cholestatic ; cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@ ticlopidine @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis ; hepatotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ ticlopidine @CHEMICAL@ jaundice @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. In experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.",puromycin aminonucleoside ; pan @CHEMICAL@ nephrotic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ puromycin aminonucleoside ; pan @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"NO-induced migraine attack: strong increase in plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and negative correlation with platelet serotonin release. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin. Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model.",no @CHEMICAL@ migraineurs (without aura) @DISEASE@ @CID@ nitroglycerin @CHEMICAL@ migraineurs (without aura) @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Coronary aneurysm after implantation of a paclitaxel-eluting stent. Formation of coronary aneurysm is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents, but based on experimental studies drug-eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition, aneurysm formation and with the potential of stent thrombosis or vessel rupture. We present a 43-year-old man who developed a coronary aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel-eluting stent. The patient was asymptomatic and the aneurysm was detected in a routine control.

"Behavioral effects of urotensin-II centrally administered in mice. Urotensin-II (U-II) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U-II have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of U-II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of U-II (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of U-II also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U-II at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. These data suggest that U-II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders.",apomorphine @CHEMICAL@ penile erection @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Pharmacological modulation of pain-related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans. Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system (central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury (secondary hyperalgesia). Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain. Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration. We found that (i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation. The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal. These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ secondary hyperalgesia ; neurogenic hyperalgesia ; hyperalgesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"MDMA polydrug users show process-specific central executive impairments coupled with impaired social and emotional judgement processes. In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on ""prefrontal"" mediated social and emotional judgement processes. Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non-ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). Compared with MDMA-free polydrug controls, MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes. The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use. These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.","mdma ; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ; ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ impaired social and emotional judgement processes @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation. We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.",citrate ; sodium citrate @CHEMICAL@ hypocalcemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients. Sirolimus (SRL) is a new, potent immunosuppressive agent. More recently, proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion. The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy, due to chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) (n = 15) neoplasia (n = 8); Kaposi's sarcoma, Four skin cancers, One intestinal tumors, One renal cell carsinom) or BK virus nephropathy (n = 2). SRL was started at a mean of 78 +/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation. Mean follow-up on SRL therapy was 20 +/- 12 (6 to 43) months. Proteinuria increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g/d before conversion to 3.2 g/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001). Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no proteinuria, whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria. In 28% of patients proteinuria remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients. In 40% it increased by more than 100%. Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range. Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis. These patients showed persistently good graft function. Serum creatinine values did not change significantly: 1.98 +/- 0.8 mg/dL before SRL therapy and 2.53 +/- 1.9 mg/dL at last follow-up (P = .14). Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis. Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi's sarcoma. Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1.26 (0.5 to 3.5) g/d before and 4.7 (3 to 12) g/d after conversion (P = .01). Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2.21 mg/dL and thereafter, 4.93 mg/dL (P = .02). Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation. Therefore, conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria.

"In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat. In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (BZDs/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.",benzodiazepines ; bzds @CHEMICAL@ dizziness @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzodiazepines ; bzds @CHEMICAL@ inability to sleep @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzodiazepines ; bzds @CHEMICAL@ tiredness @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzodiazepines ; bzds @CHEMICAL@ depressive symptoms @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication. Acute peripheral neuropathy caused by a disulfiram overdose is very rare and there is no report of it leading to vocal fold palsy. A 49-year-old woman was transferred to our department because of quadriparesis, lancinating pain, sensory loss, and paresthesia of the distal limbs. One month previously, she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram (130 tablets of ALCOHOL STOP TAB, Shin-Poong Pharm. Co., Ansan, Korea) in a suicide attempt. She was not an alcoholic. For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer.

"Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. OBJECTIVES: To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two-step heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antigen assay with thrombosis; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high heparin concentration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia (<150 x 10(9)/L) after exposure to heparin, who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin] were included in the study. RESULTS: Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis; 54/94 had isolated-HIT without thrombosis. Eight of the isolated-HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d; thus, a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30. At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated-HIT. However, OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis (n = 48, 1.34 +/- 0.89), including isolated-HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d (n = 8, 1.84 +/- 0.64) as compared to isolated-HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis (0.96 +/- 0.75; P = 0.011 and P = 0.008). The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD >1.27 in the isolated-HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30. None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition. Multivariate analysis showed a 2.8-fold increased risk of thrombosis in females. Similarly, thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values. CONCLUSION: Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent thrombosis in patients with isolated-HIT; percent inhibition, however, was not predictive.",heparin @CHEMICAL@ thrombosis ; thrombotic @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia ; hit @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Protective effect of verapamil on gastric hemorrhagic ulcers in severe atherosclerotic rats. Studies concerning with pathogenesis of gastric hemorrhage and mucosal ulceration produced in atherosclerotic rats are lacking. The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell histamine release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol. Additionally, the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis. Control rats received corn oil only. After gastric surgery, rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline. Gastric acid back-diffusion, mucosal LPO generation, histamine concentration, microvascular permeability, luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined. Elevated atherosclerotic parameters, such as serum calcium, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats. Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors, including gastric acid back-diffusion, histamine release, LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats. Moreover, a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats. This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose-dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil. Atherosclerosis could produce gastric hemorrhagic ulcer via aggravation of gastric acid back-diffusion, LPO generation, histamine release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by verapamil in rats.",vitamin d2 @CHEMICAL@ gastric hemorrhagic ; gastric hemorrhage ; hemorrhagic @DISEASE@ @CID@ vitamin d2 @CHEMICAL@ ulcers ; ulcer @DISEASE@ @CID@ vitamin d2 @CHEMICAL@ atherosclerotic ; atherosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ cholesterol @CHEMICAL@ gastric hemorrhagic ; gastric hemorrhage ; hemorrhagic @DISEASE@ @CID@ cholesterol @CHEMICAL@ ulcers ; ulcer @DISEASE@ @CID@ cholesterol @CHEMICAL@ atherosclerotic ; atherosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Adriamycin-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart failure. BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin. Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway.",adriamycin @CHEMICAL@ heart failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Confusion, a rather serious adverse drug reaction with valproic acid: a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database. INTRODUCTION: Confusion is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with valproic acid. Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published. We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction. METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid. RESULTS: 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid: 153 women and 119 men. Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure (39.7%). It was ""serious"" for almost 2/3 of the patients (62.5%) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases (82%). The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years. CONCLUSION: This work shows that confusion with valproic acid is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction. It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment.",valproic acid @CHEMICAL@ confusion @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task. It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.",ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ learning deficits ; impairments in learning ; deficits in learning @DISEASE@ @CID@ ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ memory deficits ; impairments in memory ; deficits in memory @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prolonged elevation of plasma argatroban in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or HIT with thrombosis (HITT) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In the following report, a 65-year-old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. The patient required massive transfusion support (55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay. RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment]). CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient's extended coagulopathy. Because DTIs do not have reversal agents, surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents. This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy.",argatroban @CHEMICAL@ intraoperative bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@ argatroban @CHEMICAL@ postoperative bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antituberculosis therapy-induced acute liver failure: magnitude, profile, prognosis, and predictors of outcome. Antituberculosis therapy (ATT)-associated acute liver failure (ATT-ALF) is the commonest drug-induced ALF in South Asia. Prospective studies on ATT-ALF are lacking. The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in ATT-ALF. From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. Another 15 (1.2%) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection. In 44 (62.8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis. ATT-ALF patients were younger (32.87 [+/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women. Most had hyperacute presentation; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4.5 (0-30) days. The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 (7-350) days. At presentation, advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 (76%) and 29 (41.4%) patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal bleed, seizures, infection, and acute renal failure were documented in seven (10%), five (7.1%), 26 (37.1%), and seven (10%) patients, respectively. Compared with hepatitis E virus (HEV) and non-A non-E-induced ALF, ATT-ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes. The mortality rate among patients with ATT-ALF was high (67.1%, n = 47), and only 23 (32.9%) patients recovered with medical treatment. In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin (>or=10.8 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade III/IV encephalopathy at presentation. CONCLUSION: ATT-ALF constituted 5.7% of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate. Because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important. A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically, which could have been prevented.",antituberculosis @CHEMICAL@ acute liver failure ; alf @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Central nervous system complications during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a single pediatric institution. Central nervous system (CNS) complications during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain a challenging clinical problem. Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events. This study analyzed the incidence of neurological complications during ALL treatment in a single pediatric institution, focusing on clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological findings. Exclusion criteria included CNS leukemic infiltration at diagnosis, therapy-related peripheral neuropathy, late-onset encephalopathy, or long-term neurocognitive defects. During a 9-year period, we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events (11%) in as many patients, from 253 children enrolled in the ALL front-line protocol. CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (n = 10), stroke (n = 5), temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 2), high-dose methotrexate toxicity (n = 2), syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (n = 1), and other unclassified events (n = 7). In conclusion, CNS complications are frequent events during ALL therapy, and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage.",methotrexate @CHEMICAL@ central nervous system complications ; central nervous system (cns) complications ; neurological complications ; neurocognitive defects @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety of capecitabine: a review. IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Fluoropyrimidines, in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors, including colorectal, breast and head and neck cancers, for > 40 years. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews the pharmacology and efficacy of capecitabine with a special emphasis on its safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain better insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as patients with advanced age, renal and kidney disease. We also explore different dosing and schedules of capecitabine administration. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and was developed to fulfill the need for a more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety/efficacy profile. It has shown promising results alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in colorectal, breast, pancreaticobiliary, gastric, renal cell and head and neck cancers. The most commonly reported toxic effects of capecitabine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome.

"Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy: behavioral and electrophysiological studies. OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin. CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin-induced antiparkinsonian effects.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ parkinsonian catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside-induced hypotension. The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent. Before nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly, P less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT. Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables. However, 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS/QT. During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm H2O), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",nitroprusside ; sodium nitroprusside @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; decrease in arterial blood pressure ; decreases in arterial blood pressure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal bradycardia by L-dopa via central dopamine formation in dogs. L-Dopa (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with MK-486 (25 mg/kg i.v.) in anesthetize MAO-inhibited dogs. In addition, reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by L-dopa, DL-Threo-dihydroxyphenylserine had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to norepinephrine. FLA-63, a dopamine-beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the hypotension, bradycardia or reflex-enhancing effect of L-dopa. Pimozide did not affect the actions of L-dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes. Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine. However, L-dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. 5-HTP (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine. It is concluded that L-dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha-receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the effects are mediated through dopamine rather than norepinephrine and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors.",norepinephrine @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cocaine-induced myocardial infarction: clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations. Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction. In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine-induced increase in rate-pressure product. In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction, coronary occlusion may be due to spasm, thrombus, or both. With regard to spasm, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction. Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete infarction. Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite. The finding of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects. Finally, the contribution of a primary, thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction ; acute myocardial infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting theophylline tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/mL) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for ipratropium and 17% and 50%, respectively, for theophylline. The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline. The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipratropium and 2.4 hours with theophylline. While side effects were rare, those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems.

"Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats. Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats. Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN.

"Less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once-per-day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules. Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose.

"Effect of adriamycin combined with whole body hyperthermia on tumor and normal tissues. Thermal enhancement of Adriamycin-mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a F344 rat model. Antitumor activity was studied using a tumor growth delay assay. Acute normal tissue toxicities (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) and late normal tissue toxicities (i.e., myocardial and kidney injury) were evaluated by functional/physiological assays and by morphological techniques. Whole body hyperthermia (120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both Adriamycin-mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects. The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1.6. Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for ""acute"" hematological changes were 1.3, whereas those estimated for ""late"" damage (based on morphological cardiac and renal lesions) varied between 2.4 and 4.3. Thus, while whole body hyperthermia enhances Adriamycin-mediated antitumor effect, normal tissue toxicity is also increased, and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is eroded.",adriamycin @CHEMICAL@ myocardial injury ; cardiac lesions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prazosin-induced stress incontinence. A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented. Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra. The patient's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil. Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication. The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length.

"Systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension in ventilated dogs. The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.",sodium nitroprusside ; snp @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@

Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane-induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. Flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical Kety-Schmidt technique using xenon-133 i.v. Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.75% (plus 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen), during which CBF and CMRO2 were 34.3 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g min-1 and 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1 at PaCO2 4.1 +/- 0.1 kPa (mean +/- SEM). Controlled hypotension to an average MAP of 50-55 mm Hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO2 (to 1.73 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1), while CBF was unchanged. After the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75%.

"Rebound hypertensive after sodium nitroprusside prevented by saralasin in rats. The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension was evaluated. Control rats received halothane anesthesia (1 MAC) for one hour, followed by SNP infusion, 40 microgram/kg/min, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min recovery period. A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of saralasin (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II) throughout the experimental period. In each group, SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr. During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin-treated animals showed no change. Following discontinuation of SNP, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin-treated rats. This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post-SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin. This demonstrates the participation of the renin--angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP.",sodium nitroprusside ; snp @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@ halothane @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N  omercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd  ne) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.",carbimazole ; n omercazole @CHEMICAL@ toxic hepatitis ; hepatic adverse effects ; hepatitis ; hepatotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbimazole ; n omercazole @CHEMICAL@ cholestatic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Study of the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin B12 and folinic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (ZDV)-induced bone marrow suppression. Seventy-five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with folinic acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37). Finally, 15 patients were excluded from the study (noncompliance 14, death 1); thus, 60 patients (31 in group I and 29 in group II) were eligible for analysis. No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment. During the study, vitamin B12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group II patients; however, no differences in hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and white-cell, neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Severe hematologic toxicity (neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 and/or hemoglobin < 8 g/dl) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II. There was no correlation between vitamin B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression.

"Acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid. A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency.

Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved. Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with ampicillin was positive. DISCUSSION: After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out, a drug-induced allergic reaction was suspected.

"Immediate allergic reactions to amoxicillin. A large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated. A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin (AX) or were cross-reacting with other penicillin derivatives. Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl-poly-L-lysine (BPO-PLL), benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenicillin (PG), ampicillin (AMP), and AX. RAST for BPO-PLL and AX-PLL was done. When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative, single-blind, placebo-controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to AX. A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG. Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients (69%), the other 17 (31%) having urticaria and/or angioedema. All the patients were skin test negative to BPO; 49 of 51 (96%) were also negative to MDM, and 44 of 46 (96%) to PG. Skin tests with AX were positive in 34 (63%) patients. RAST was positive for AX in 22 patients (41%) and to BPO in just 5 (9%). None of the sera with negative RAST for AX were positive to BPO. Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to AX, and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative. PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients. We describe the largest group of AX-allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far.

"Habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic renal failure: a comparison with phenacetin. Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19. As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations. The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.",phenacetin @CHEMICAL@ chronic renal failure ; end-stage renal disease ; esrd @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reduction of heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue. Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The majority of anionic sites (74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively). Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002). At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed. We conclude that in streptozotocin-diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.",streptozotocin @CHEMICAL@ diabetic nephropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity. The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) administered alone or in combination [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats. After drug administration, creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as creatinine clearance. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. After MTX administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls. After the administration of NG, 5-FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was found, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX, CY and NG, while no such change was observed after 5-FU and joint administration of MTX + 5-FU + CY compared to controls.

"Lithium-associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium: a case series. BACKGROUND: Lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients.

"Treatment of previously treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone and 48-hour continuous infusion of high-dose 5-FU and leucovorin (MFL): low palliative benefit and high treatment-related toxicity. For previously treated advanced breast cancer, there is no standard second-line therapy. Combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (MFL regimen) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen. From October 1993 to November 1995, we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy-treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2, on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5-FU, 3000 mg/m2, together with leucovorin, 300 mg/m2, for 48 h from day 1 to 2. Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks. Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites, with lung metastasis predominant. Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline. Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy. Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68.35 mg/m2. One patient had complete response, seven had stable disease, none had partial response and five had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate was 7.6%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Median survival was 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months. A complete responder had relapse-free survival up to 17 months. Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia. Eight patients were dead in the last follow-up; two of them died of treatment-related toxicity. The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate.

"Upregulation of the expression of vasopressin gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the lithium-induced diabetes insipidus rat. The expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with lithium (Li)-induced polyuria, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay. The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria. The Li-treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations. Plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with those in controls. Plasma concentration of AVP and transcripts of AVP gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the Li-treated rats compared with controls. These results suggest that dehydration and/or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma AVP and the upregulation of AVP gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the Li-induced diabetes insipidus rat.",licl @CHEMICAL@ polyuria @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for at least one year. BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for more than 1 year. METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.",tacrolimus ; fk506 @CHEMICAL@ focal segmental glomerulosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser PG-9. The effects of PG-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated. In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126. In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9. The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells.

"Recurrent use of newer oral contraceptives and the risk of venous thromboembolism. The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with newer oral contraceptives (OC) did not distinguish between patterns of OC use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers. Data from a Transnational case-control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use. Over the period 1993-1996, 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls. Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns. The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills. We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills. These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer OC in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.",oral contraceptives ; oc @CHEMICAL@ venous thromboembolism ; vte @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Serotonergic antidepressants and urinary incontinence. Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade. Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature. This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine. In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline, as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine.

"Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension. Centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of spasticity related to disorders of the central nervous system. In addition to their effects on spasticity, certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported. Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked. The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine, an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of spasticity. The possible interaction of tizanidine and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either hypertension or spasticity in such patients.",tizanidine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ lisinopril @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native kidney disease: a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens. BACKGROUND: An association has been found between transplant glomerulopathy (TG) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes (PTCR). Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it. METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR. In addition to renal allografts with TG, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent glomerulonephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts (""protocol biopsies""). Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, malignant hypertension, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis. RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens. These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and cocaine-related acute renal failure. Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear. PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases, though the association is not as strong as that for TG. We suggest that repeated endothelial injury, including immunologic injury, may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Conformationally restricted analogs of BD1008 and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti-cocaine effects in mice. Cocaine's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects. Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: BD1018 (3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), BD1063 (1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine), and LR132 (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine. At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, BD1018, BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine-induced behaviors.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ convulsions ; convulsive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment of the effects of E4031, cisapride, terfenadine and terodiline on monophasic action potential duration in dog. 1. Torsades de pointes (TDP) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). TDP is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. terfenadine and terodiline). 2. The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog. Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated: terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride and E4031. On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man. Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3. These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine (1.9 nM), terodiline (76 nM), cisapride (11 nM) and E4031 (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects. For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic (terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man (< 10-fold) reflecting their limited safety margins. These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to TDP in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.",cisapride @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@ terfenadine @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@ terodiline @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@

The girl died seven days, the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of vincristine. Clinically, the onset was characterized by the signs of opistothonus, sensory and motor dysfunction and ascending paralysis. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations (HE-LFB, CD-68, Neurofilament) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as pseudocystic transformation in areas exposed to vincristine, accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages.

"Intravenous administration of prochlorperazine by 15-minute infusion versus 2-minute bolus does not affect the incidence of akathisia: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rate of akathisia after administration of intravenous prochlorperazine as a 2-minute bolus or 15-minute infusion. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in the emergency department of a central-city teaching hospital. Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache, nausea, or vomiting were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2-minute push (bolus group) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15-minute period (infusion group). The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration. Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient-reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator-observed akathisia rating scale. The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. One study participant was excluded after protocol violation. Seventy-three percent (73/99) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70% (70/99) for nausea. In the bolus group, 26.0% (13/50) had akathisia compared with 32.7% (16/49) in the infusion group (Delta=-6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.6% to 11.2%). The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50% reduction in their headache intensity within 30 minutes was 11.8% (95% CI -9.6% to 33.3%). The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in their nausea was 12.6% (95% CI -4.6% to 29.8%). CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of akathisia when prochlorperazine was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. The efficacy of prochlorperazine in the treatment of headache and nausea likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration, although no formal statistical comparisons were made.",prochlorperazine @CHEMICAL@ akathisia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure-prone and withdrawal seizure-resistant selected mouse lines. BACKGROUND: The septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity. Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na  ve Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; convulsions ; convulsion ; convulsants @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbachol @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; convulsions ; convulsion ; convulsants @DISEASE@ @CID@ neostigmine @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; convulsions ; convulsion ; convulsants @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat. Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.",dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; increase in blood pressure ; elevated blood pressures @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ renal injury ; reduction in glomerular number @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study. BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (CPA/EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for CPA/EE use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs.

"Combined androgen blockade-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. BACKGROUND: To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta).

"Organophosphate-induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological damages. Such organophosphorus (OP) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.",diisopropylfluorophosphate ; dfp @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-imidazoline receptor-mediated hypotension in female rats. We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction. The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and/or I1-receptors. Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine (600 microg/kg) or alpha-methyldopa (100 mg/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement. Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. In sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. SDRR was reduced only by alpha-methyldopa. Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension. The enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity. Estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha-methyldopa to sham-operated levels. These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha-methyldopa-estrogen interaction.",rilmenidine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@ alpha-methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ hypotension ; hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cardioprotective effect of tincture of Crataegus on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.

"Safety and adverse effects associated with raloxifene: multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of raloxifene on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal estrogen therapy or tamoxifen. METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7).

"Ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients. It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables.

"Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody GNC92H2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine overdose. The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine overdose remains elusive. Current protein-based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream, inactivating its toxic effects. The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine overdose. Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg/kg (LD50) of cocaine and GNC92H2 infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg/kg. GNC92H2 was delivered 30 min before, concomitantly or 3 min after cocaine treatment. Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, seizures up to 77% and death by 72%. Importantly, GNC92H2 prevented death even post-cocaine injection.

"The effects of short-term raloxifene therapy on fibrinolysis markers: TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1. BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were studied for the evaluation of short-term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only calcium. Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits. Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test. Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33).

Ketoconazole is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drugs. We report a woman with coronary artery disease who developed a markedly prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes (TdP) after taking ketoconazole for treatment of fungal infection. Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of ketoconazole. Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins. We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, ketoconazole alone may prolong QT interval and induce TdP. This calls for attention when ketoconazole is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome.",ketoconazole @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@ ketoconazole @CHEMICAL@ prolonged qt interval ; long qt syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.",diazepam @CHEMICAL@ amnesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report. OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours. CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare. Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ cauda equina syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ triamcinolone diacetate @CHEMICAL@ cauda equina syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@
"High-dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVES: To study the long-term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (estradiol- and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use. No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless.",testosterone @CHEMICAL@ atherosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Sirolimus-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction. Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.",sirolimus ; rapamycin @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ sirolimus ; rapamycin @CHEMICAL@ renal dysfunction ; nephropathy ; nephrotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Progressive myopathy with up-regulation of MHC-I associated with statin therapy. Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug. What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases. All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate. In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-necrotic fibres. Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate, and in one case spontaneously. These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune-mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. The mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres.",statin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ myopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ statin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ necrosis ; necrotic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine. BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.",clonidine @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Influence of smoking on developing cochlea. Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns? OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.",smoking @CHEMICAL@ hearing loss ; hearing impairment @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats: implications for autism. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behaviors. In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism. Terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given terbutaline (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism. This study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying autism spectrum disorders.",terbutaline @CHEMICAL@ autism @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute myocarditis associated with clozapine. OBJECTIVE: A case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use. RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine. The patient recovered with intensive medical support. The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient setting. Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and unaccustomed physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine. It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early. Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis, there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients.

"Norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine-induced anxiety. BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect.

"Clonidine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for clonidine and 60 mg/day for methylphenidate (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs. RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p =.0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common on clonidine, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD.

"Thalidomide has limited single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas: a phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B. Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu, including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines. Between July 2001 and April 2004, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1-2 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mg daily. Patients had received a median of 2 (range, 1-4) prior regimens. Of 24 evaluable patients, two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.6-32.4%). Eleven patients progressed during therapy. Grade 3-4 adverse effects included myelosuppression, fatigue, somnolence/depressed mood, neuropathy and dyspnea.

"The glycine transporter-1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice. Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.",amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@ mk-801 @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@ haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ olanzapine @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ clozapine @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ aripiprazole @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension. BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2).

"A novel, multiple symptom model of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in animals. BACKGROUND: Current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety. None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2C, but not serotonin 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD-like profile in animals. Moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD. This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders.",clomipramine @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@ clomipramine @CHEMICAL@ memory impairment @DISEASE@ @CID@ clomipramine @CHEMICAL@ hoarding @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Effects of acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and hydrocortisone on epinephrine-induced myocardial injury in dogs. A reproducible model for producing diffuse myocardial injury (epinephrine infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute myocardial infarction. Infusions of epinephrine (4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased radiocalcium uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline-infused control animals (4,957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction). Myocardial concentrations of calcium also increased significantly (12.0 vs. 5.0 mg.per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight). Infusions of calcium chloride sufficient to raise serum calcium concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase calcium influx into the myocardial cell. Mitochondrial radiocalcium uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid or dipyridamole or when hydrocortisone was added to the epinephrine infusion (2,682,2,803, and 3,424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively). Myocardial calcium concentrations also were decreased (11.2, 8.3, and 8.9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two. Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups.

During the six-month follow up, depression was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months. In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control). These results suggest that betaxolol could be less of a depression-inducer than timolol in predisposed patients.",timolol @CHEMICAL@ depressive ; depression @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Long-term follow-up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors: an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report. The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment. Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide (six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin [IVA]). None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy. Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females. The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck. Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, urinary pH, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria. Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had renal abnormalities. Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi's syndrome (TDFS); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption. The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria. Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement. This low percentage (5%) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children.",ifosfamide @CHEMICAL@ renal toxicity ; renal abnormalities @DISEASE@ @CID@ ifosfamide @CHEMICAL@ fanconi's syndrome ; tdfs @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced hyperactivity in rats. Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation. In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. Nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect. The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment. The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors, possibly located on dopaminergic neurons, and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity ; increase in locomotor activity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of mefloquine. This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with mefloquine. Reactions consisted mainly of seizures, acute psychoses, anxiety neurosis, and major disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm. Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe. In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany, it is estimated that one of 8,000 mefloquine users suffers from such reactions. The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended.",mefloquine @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ mefloquine @CHEMICAL@ psychoses @DISEASE@ @CID@ mefloquine @CHEMICAL@ anxiety neurosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ mefloquine @CHEMICAL@ disturbances of sleep-wake rhythm @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization. Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution. To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area. The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03). The pH adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues.",lidocaine @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy. There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed.

"Pentoxifylline (Trental) does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia: implications for dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging. Dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.",pentoxifylline ; trental ; pentoxyifylline @CHEMICAL@ intermittent claudication @DISEASE@ @CID@ dipyridamole @CHEMICAL@ hyperemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cause of death among patients with Parkinson's disease: a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage. Causes of death, with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage, among 240 patients with pathologically verified Parkinson's disease were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985. The leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis (44.1%), malignant neoplasms (11.6%), heart diseases (4.1%), cerebral infarction (3.7%) and septicaemia (3.3%). Cerebral haemorrhage was the 11th most frequent cause of death, accounting for only 0.8% of deaths among the patients, whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the Japanese general population in 1985. The low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with Parkinson's disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) of more than 8 days of evolution. Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers. The average time of death was delayed. A reversible anemia was the only adverse effect observed. From these results, we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF, and that anemia, the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed.

"Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback. Nitroprusside-induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation. Portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradigm. Application of a delayed feedback signal, in the form of a 2-h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane-anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis, is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose tested. Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate, which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms/dl. Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to nitroprusside-induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8-12 micrograms/dl. These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release.",nitroprusside @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the effect of pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or with desipramine and 6-OHDA and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats. The cataleptogenic effect of THC was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6-OHDA and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA, as compared with control rats. On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6-OHDA but not in rats treated with 6-OHDA or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus.

"Intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil-induced rigidity. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.",alfentanil @CHEMICAL@ rigidity ; somatic rigidity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with cis-platin and 5-fluorouracil. Survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and/or surgery. Obviously, there is a need for effective chemotherapy. In the present study, cis-platin (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery. The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment. Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed. In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients (43%). During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%). The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years. The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation. The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, ST-T wave changes and atrial fibrillation. This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another.

"Serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy. Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine. Twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.","deferoxamine @CHEMICAL@ visual neurotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ deferoxamine @CHEMICAL@ abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 hz @DISEASE@ @CID@"

"The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox-induced neuropathic damage in rats. The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox (N, N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate), a neurotoxic organophosphate. Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long-Evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of Mipafox (ip, 1-15 mg/kg). These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure. Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats. In contrast, dosages of Mipafox (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of cord damage in only 9% of the animals.

Because of the rapid systemic clearance of BCNU (1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea), intra-arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Thirty-six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg/sq m body surface area. Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans.

Intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously. Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration-blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline levels.

"Age and renal clearance of cimetidine. In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. Cimetidine clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml.

The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl. Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety and side-effects of alprazolam. Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder. BACKGROUND: The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low.

"Sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile dysfunction. In an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications. A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine, 100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin E1 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of sodium bicarbonate (0.03 mEq.). Of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain. From these data we conclude that the penile pain following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication, which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level.",phentolamine @CHEMICAL@ penile pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ prostaglandin e1 @CHEMICAL@ penile pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients. This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.",octreotide @CHEMICAL@ gallstone ; gallstones @DISEASE@ @CID@ octreotide @CHEMICAL@ acute cholecystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Morphological features of encephalopathy after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug valproate to rats. A transmission electron microscopic study of capillaries in the cerebellar cortex. Long-term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (Vupral ""Polfa"") at the effective dose of 200 mg/kg b. w. once daily to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months revealed neurological disorders indicating cerebellum damage (""valproate encephalopathy""). The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment. They became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells. Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered. Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli. Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes. Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions. Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed. Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes. The proliferation of astrocytes (Bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found. Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells are earliest). In electron micrographs both luminal and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions. The possible influence of the hepatic damage, mainly hyperammonemia, upon the development of valproate encephalopathy is discussed.",valproate ; sodium valproate @CHEMICAL@ encephalopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Epidemic of liver disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone-sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons. BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). Trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.","1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane ; hcfc 123 ; hcfcs 123 @CHEMICAL@ liver disease @DISEASE@ @CID@ 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane ; hcfc 124 ; hcfcs 124 @CHEMICAL@ liver disease @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"The effect of different anaesthetic agents in hearing loss following spinal anaesthesia. The cause of hearing loss after spinal anaesthesia is unknown. Up until now, the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post-operative sensorineural hearing loss. The aim of this study was to describe this hearing loss and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of hearing loss. Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied: one group received 6 mL prilocaine 2%; and the other received 3 mL bupivacaine 0.5%. Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing loss (10 out of 22) than those given bupivacaine (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05). The average hearing loss for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after prilocaine and 15 dB after bupivacaine. None of the patients complained of subjective hearing loss.

"A transient neurological deficit following intrathecal injection of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anaesthesia. We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength. Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ loss of pinprick sensation @DISEASE@ @CID@
Pethidine-associated seizure in a healthy adolescent receiving pethidine for postoperative pain control. A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of postoperative pain control. Twenty-three h postoperatively he developed a brief self-limited seizure. Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation. No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified. This method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine.

"Drug-associated acute-onset vanishing bile duct and Stevens-Johnson syndromes in a child. Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults, is most often drug or toxin related, and is of unknown pathogenesis. It has not been reported previously in children. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a well-recognized immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups, is drug or infection induced, and has classic systemic, mucosal, and dermatologic manifestations. A previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after Stevens-Johnson syndrome is described; this was temporally associated with ibuprofen use. Despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisone, and then tacrolimus, her cholestatic disease was unrelenting, with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation.

"High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension.

The prevalence rate for CIMD was 12% at baseline. Introduction of the DSM-IV diagnosis of CIMD did not substantially affect rates of the other depressive disorders. Patients with CIMD had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a mood disorder.

"Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure. Tamoxifen (TAM), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia. This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM-induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM-induced hemolysis. Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM-induced cell oxidative stress. Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either alpha-T or alpha-TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, TAM-induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.",tamoxifen ; tam @CHEMICAL@ hemolysis ; hemolytic @DISEASE@ @CID@ tamoxifen ; tam @CHEMICAL@ hemolytic anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension. In the cardiovascular system, NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions. Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension. In several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue. To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na+, we studied the response of cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase to NO-deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 4 four weeks. After 4-week administration of L-NAME, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 36%. Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value. When activating the (Na,K)-ATPase with its substrate ATP, no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO-deficient rats. During activation with Na+, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the K(Na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na+-binding site in NO-deficient rats. After recovery from hypertension, the activity of (Na,K)-ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP-binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP. The K(Na) value for Na+ returned to control value. Inhibition of NO-synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na+-binding properties of the (Na,K)-ATPase. After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of Na+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (Na,K)-ATPase activity.",nitric oxide ; no @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. It has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ cardiac hypertrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@ isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ bromocriptine @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ bromocriptine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ domperidone @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A developmental analysis of clonidine's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats. Under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine. Previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration (0.5 mg/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine-induced bradycardia. This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by-product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function.",clonidine @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Differential effects of systemically administered ketamine and lidocaine on dynamic and static hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans. We have examined the effect of systemic administration of ketamine and lidocaine on brush-evoked (dynamic) pain and punctate-evoked (static) hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments. Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i.v. infusion of ketamine (bolus 0.1 mg kg-1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg-1 min-1), lidocaine 5 mg kg-1 or saline for 50 min. Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin. The following were measured: spontaneous pain, pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli (VAS), and areas of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia. Ketamine reduced both the area of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush-evoked pain. Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly. It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain. The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ hyperalgesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cyclosporine and tacrolimus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. The development of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented. Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion. However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine. As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine-induced TMA. With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus-associated TMA has also been recognized. However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited. We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine-induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft.

"Repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney. We report the case of a 70-year-old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic renal insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration. He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, treated with high-dose diuretics. Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed. Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion. One week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours. During these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted. Ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% renal artery stenosis. In this patient, renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Under such conditions, angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this setting.",losartan @CHEMICAL@ anuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone-induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract. Grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.",acetaminophen ; aap @CHEMICAL@ necrotic ; necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ acetaminophen ; aap @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone ; ami @CHEMICAL@ necrotic ; necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone ; ami @CHEMICAL@ lung toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ necrotic ; necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@

Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22 ua; P<0.001). Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au). Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg/kg naloxone s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed. In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects. The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine-induced constipation. These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ constipation ; constipating @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis. CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (IFX) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX.",ifosfamide ; ifx @CHEMICAL@ encephalopathy ; structural lesions of the brain @DISEASE@ @CID@ ifosfamide ; ifx @CHEMICAL@ myoclonus @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Sub-chronic low dose gamma-vinyl GABA (vigabatrin) inhibits cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens dopamine. RATIONALE: gamma-Vinyl GABA (GVG) irreversibly inhibits GABA-transaminase. This non-receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional GABA catabolism. OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects (VFD) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose GVG on cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA). METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure (450 mg/kg) to an identical sub-chronic exposure (150 mg/kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1- or 3-day washout. Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg/kg (50 mg/kg per day) using a similar washout period. RESULTS: Sub-chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine-induced increases in dopamine, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS.",gamma-vinyl gaba ; vigabatrin ; gvg @CHEMICAL@ visual field defects ; vfd @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Amount of bleeding and hematoma size in the collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage rat model. The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully. We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration. In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0.014-unit, 0.070-unit, and 0.350-unit collagenase, the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume. The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated, and the hematoma induced by 0.014-unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration. In ICH induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7.6-fold. Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection, and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low-dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH.",heparin @CHEMICAL@ hematoma @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Estradiol reduces seizure-induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats. Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE). We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE. Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. The extent of silver-stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE. 17beta-Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats. In males, estradiol increased the total damage score. These findings suggest that the effects of estradiol on seizure threshold and damage may be altered by sex-related differences in the hormonal environment.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ hippocampal injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus ; se @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ hippocampal injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus ; se @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Delirium during clozapine treatment: incidence and associated risk factors. BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification. METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium, and tested associations with potential risk factors. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40.8 +/- 12.1 years, hospitalized for 24.9 +/- 23.3 days, and given clozapine, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 +/- 203 mg (3.45 +/- 2.45 mg/kg) for 18.9 +/- 16.4 days. Delirium was diagnosed in 14 (10.1 % incidence, or 1.48 cases/person-years of exposure); 71.4 % of cases were moderate or severe. Associated factors were co-treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents, poor clinical outcome, older age, and longer hospitalization (by 17.5 days, increasing cost); sex, diagnosis or medical co-morbidity, and daily clozapine dose, which fell with age, were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics. Delirium was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length-of-stay and higher costs, and inferior clinical outcome.",clozapine @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex--an experimental model for vascular dysfunctions in cluster headache. Cluster headache is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and intracranial vascular disturbances. Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions. An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa. Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry. Capsaicin (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation. These responses were blocked by systemic pre-administration of hexamethonium chloride (20 mg/kg). The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre-administration of atropine (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater. We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex. The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of acetylcholine and VIP within the meninges. Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ vascular dysfunctions ; intracranial vascular disturbances @DISEASE@ @CID@ capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ increases in dural and cortical blood flow ; increases in dural blood flow @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Similar to rats, systemic pilocarpine injection causes status epilepticus (SE) and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice. Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from pilocarpine-treated and untreated mice. In Mg(2+)-free bathing medium containing bicuculline, conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine-treated mice that did not experience SE. In SE survivors, similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed, at a variable latency, by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3-60 s duration, which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1-30 s duration in slices from SE survivors but not other groups. These data support the hypothesis that SE-induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of seizure development in these murine strains, resembling rat models of human temporal lobe epilepsy.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus ; se @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice. Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester: a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity. The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin, but further studies are needed to confirm this.Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost. Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO, we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss. In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague-Dawley rats, 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear. The otoprotectant L-NAME was administered topically to 12/27 animals. Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss, measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold.

"Cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult: a case report. Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine. Cerebral vasculitis associated with amphetamine abuse is well documented, and in rare cases ischaemic stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children. We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes. We consider drug-induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy. This potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate.",methylphenidate @CHEMICAL@ cerebral vasculitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cerebral haemorrhage induced by warfarin - the influence of drug-drug interactions. PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of warfarin-induced cerebral haemorrhages due to warfarin and warfarin-drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg  tland, Sweden. METHODS: All patients with a diagnosed cerebral haemorrhage at three hospitals during the period 2000-2002 were identified. Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin-drug interactions could have caused the cerebral haemorrhage. The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated. RESULTS: Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment. This imply an incidence of 1.7/100,000 treatment years. Of the 59 cases, 26 (44%) had a fatal outcome, compared to 136 (25%) among the non-warfarin patients (p < 0.01). A warfarin-drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 (41%) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these (12%) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin-induced cerebral haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. Almost half of the cases was related to a warfarin-drug interaction. A significant proportion of warfarin-related cerebral haemorrhages might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with warfarin.",warfarin @CHEMICAL@ cerebral haemorrhage ; cerebral haemorrhages @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients (CARE) study: a randomized double-blind trial of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease. BACKGROUND: No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low-osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso-osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after iopamidol and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after iodixanol (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44). In patients with diabetes, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with iopamidol and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with iodixanol (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol/L, P=0.03; patients with diabetes: 0.07 versus 0.16 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol/L, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by multiple end points, is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high-risk patients, with or without diabetes mellitus.

"A novel compound, maltolyl p-coumarate, attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models. To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function.",scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ cognitive deficits ; cognitive decline ; decline of cognitive function @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Mutations associated with lamivudine-resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients with and without HIV co-infection: implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients. This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-na  ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-na  ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (HBsAg-negative) and 7 overt HBV (HBsAg- positive) patients. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). HBV lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na  ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.",hbsag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b virus (hbv) infected ; hbv infected ; hepatitis b ; hbv mono-infected @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Sex differences in NMDA antagonist enhancement of morphine antihyperalgesia in a capsaicin model of persistent pain: comparisons to two models of acute pain. In acute pain models, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females. The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated, neurochemical substrates, and duration of the nociceptive stimulus. To this end, persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. For comparison, tests were conducted in two acute pain models, the hotplate and warm water tail-withdrawal procedures. In males, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Across the doses and pretreatment times examined, enhancement was not observed in females. Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males. These findings demonstrate a sexually-dimorphic interaction between NMDA antagonists and morphine in a persistent pain model that can be distinguished from those observed in acute pain models.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ hyperalgesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients. Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients.

"Methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling. Methamphetamine (METH) damages dopamine (DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.",methamphetamine ; meth @CHEMICAL@ neurodegeneration ; cns damage @DISEASE@ @CID@ mptp @CHEMICAL@ neurodegeneration ; cns damage @DISEASE@ @CID@

Valvular heart abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with pergolide. However, the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case-control study. METHODS: All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography. Thirty PD patients participated in the study. A second echocardiography was performed (median interval: 13 months) after pergolide withdrawal (n=10 patients). Controls were age- and sex-matched non-PD patients referred to the cardiology department. RESULTS: Compared to controls, aortic regurgitation (OR: 3.1; 95% IC: 1.1-8.8) and mitral regurgitation (OR: 10.7; 95% IC: 2.1-53) were more frequent in PD patients (tricuspid: NS). The number of affected valves (n=2.4+/-0.7) and the sum of regurgitation grades (n=2.8+/-1.09) were higher (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively) in the pergolide group. Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose. A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation, suggestive of the role of pergolide, was observed in 12/30 (40%) patients including two with heart failure. Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease, resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination. This study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in PD patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non-ergot dopamine agonists.",pergolide @CHEMICAL@ aortic regurgitation @DISEASE@ @CID@ pergolide @CHEMICAL@ mitral regurgitation @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Adverse effects of topical papaverine on auditory nerve function. BACKGROUND: Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations. Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine. This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm. Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients. The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations. FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss. The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min. In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II/III-V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine. Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min. One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss. The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre-papaverine baseline values was 39 min. CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve. Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided.",papaverine ; papaverine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ sensorineural hearing loss @DISEASE@ @CID@ papaverine ; papaverine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.",alendronate ; alendronate sodium @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ alendronate ; alendronate sodium @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin-induced nephrotic syndrome. Doxorubicin-induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis. The aldosterone-sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome. To this end, doxorubicin (15 mug/g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 (sgk1(-/-)) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1(+/+)). Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites, lipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes. Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+/+) mice. Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+/+) mice (15 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) than in sgk1(-/-) mice (35 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1(+/+) compared with sgk1(-/-) mice (+6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +/- 0.8 g). During the course of nephrotic syndrome, serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-/-) mice than in sgk1(+/+) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+/+) mice). In conclusion, gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention, yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ nephrotic syndrome ; nephrotic @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ ascites @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ lipidemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ hypoalbuminemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Severe and long lasting cholestasis after high-dose co-trimoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients--a report of two cases. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, is generally treated with high doses of co-trimoxazole. However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects. Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic cholestasis, and in one patient lesions mimicking liver abscess formation on radiologic exams, during co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP. Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged co-trimoxazole treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.",co-trimoxazole @CHEMICAL@ intrahepatic cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients. BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.",sirolimus @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy middle-aged and older adults. This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain. Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg oxycodone). Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01). Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.","oxycodone @CHEMICAL@ declines in simple and sustained attention @DISEASE@ @CID@ oxycodone @CHEMICAL@ declines in working memory, and verbal memory @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Normalizing effects of modafinil on sleep in chronic cocaine users. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning-dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime sleepiness in chronic cocaine users. METHOD: Twenty cocaine-dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil, 400 mg (N=10), or placebo (N=10) every morning at 7:30 a.m. for 16 days in an inpatient, double-blind randomized trial. Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 14 to 16 (first, second, and third weeks of abstinence). The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. on days 2, 8, and 15. For comparison of sleep architecture variables, 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography. RESULTS: Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes. Compared with placebo, modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time in cocaine-dependent participants. The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence. Comparison of slow-wave sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep latency in cocaine-dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine-dependent participants. Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Morning-dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep, normalizes sleep architecture, and decreases daytime sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users. These effects may be relevant in the treatment of cocaine dependence.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ daytime sleepiness @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo- and haloperidol-controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features. In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity). With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and haloperidol (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and haloperidol (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05). On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change.

"Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts. Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.",puromycin aminonucleoside @CHEMICAL@ nephrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ puromycin aminonucleoside @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Learning of rats under amnesia caused by pentobarbital. Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital (15 mg/kg, ip) was carried out. Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement. In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of pentobarbital to run to the same shelf as in the normal state. In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states. It was shown that memory dissociation occurred in both groups. Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of pentobarbital between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed.

"Role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats. 1. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (GC-HT) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide-redox imbalance. 2. We studied the role of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone-induced hypertension (dex-HT). 3. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, dexamethasone (dex), allopurinol plus saline, and allopurinol plus dex. 4. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum urate to assess XO inhibition. 5. Dex increased SBP (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and decreased thymus (P < 0.001) and bodyweights (P"" < 0.01).

"Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.",risperidone @CHEMICAL@ drug-induced parkinsonism @DISEASE@ @CID@ haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ drug-induced parkinsonism @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation. Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy. However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.",simvastatin-ezetimibe ; simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg ; simvastatinezetimibe @CHEMICAL@ hepatotoxic ; hepatotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ simvastatin-ezetimibe ; simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg ; simvastatinezetimibe @CHEMICAL@ fulminant hepatic failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Oral manifestations of ""meth mouth"": a case report. AIM: The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of ""meth mouth"" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition. BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries (""meth mouth""), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug. SUMMARY: The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of ""meth mouth."" Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines.

"Attenuation of methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment. Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal damage. In this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine-elicited hyperthermia three days later. Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine. We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity.",methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperthermia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin-induced nephropathy. The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril. Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. These short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis. Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4. Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). Enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P less than 0.05 vs. group 3).

"Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy. BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure. The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), the most common being the K- and the A-variants. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT. METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months. We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects. RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent. The duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea. We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT.",succinylcholine @CHEMICAL@ apnea @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department. BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.",ketamine ; ketamine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ ketamine ; ketamine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ emesis @DISEASE@ @CID@ ketamine ; ketamine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ clumsiness ; ataxic movements @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic disorders. The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive patients with rheumatologic disease. From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs Ag positive patients with rheumatologic diseases, who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed. Liver function tests, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers, and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow-up were obtained from hospital file records. Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU/l, AST:111 IU/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU/l, AST:274 IU/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up. None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation. Lamivudine was well tolerated and was continued in all patients. Prophylactic administration of lamivudine in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe, well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation.",hepatitis b virus surface antigen ; hbs ag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety of transesophageal echocardiography in adults: study in a multidisciplinary hospital. BACKGROUND: TEE is a semi-invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety. OBJECTIVE: to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan (MZ) and Flumazenil (FL) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate. METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.",midazolan ; mz @CHEMICAL@ hypoxia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine-induced toxicity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine-induced acute toxicity. For each of the three tested calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil and bepridil) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses, i.e. 2 and 10 mg/kg/i.p., or an equal volume of saline for the control group (n = 20); 15 minutes later, all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg/kg/i.p. dose of bupivacaine. The convulsant activity, the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group. The local anesthetic-induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different calcium channel blockers. The convulsant activity of bupivacaine was not significantly modified but calcium channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain bupivacaine-induced convulsions; this effect was less pronounced with bepridil.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Selegiline-induced postural hypotension in Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal. OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa alone. Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.",selegiline @CHEMICAL@ postural hypotension ; systolic orthostatic hypotension ; orthostatic hypotension ; reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Explicit episodic memory for sensory-discriminative components of capsaicin-induced pain: immediate and delayed ratings. Pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain conditions. Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse. In order to address long-term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection. Subjects also recalled their pains one week later. Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions. The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day. Pain recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05). Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces. These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain. The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ pain ; pains @DISEASE@ @CID@

We report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney, who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captopril. His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years' treatment with captopril but returned to pre-treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug.

"Capsaicin-induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw-stretch reflex. The pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood, but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic ways. This study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw-stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch. Capsaicin (10 micro g) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers. Short-latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before, during, and after the pain. The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement, but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity. The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain, but only at faster stretches in the painful muscle. Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. In a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of ""real"" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus ""sham"" rTMS (placebo) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS (1,800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series. Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed dyskinesia severity. However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo. The major effect was on dystonia subscore. Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only. Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted. The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low-frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD. The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesias ; dyskinesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Disulfiram-like syndrome after hydrogen cyanamide professional skin exposure: two case reports in France. Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees. Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use. The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram-like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide. The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal. In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital. The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex. Five hours after exposure, he developed disulfiram-like syndrome with flushing, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine. The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital. These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use.",hydrogen cyanamide ; dormex @CHEMICAL@ flushing of the face ; flushing @DISEASE@ @CID@ hydrogen cyanamide ; dormex @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ hydrogen cyanamide ; dormex @CHEMICAL@ dyspnea @DISEASE@ @CID@ hydrogen cyanamide ; dormex @CHEMICAL@ arterial hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ alcohol @CHEMICAL@ flushing of the face ; flushing @DISEASE@ @CID@ alcohol @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ alcohol @CHEMICAL@ dyspnea @DISEASE@ @CID@ alcohol @CHEMICAL@ arterial hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation. Trimipramine (TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.",trimipramine ; tri @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@ reserpine @CHEMICAL@ hypothermia @DISEASE@ @CID@ d-amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@ quinpirole @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Toxicity in rhesus monkeys following administration of the 8-aminoquinoline 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline (WR242511). INTRODUCTION: Many substances that form methemoglobin (MHb) effectively counter cyanide (CN) toxicity. Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable toxicity.",8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline ; wr242511 @CHEMICAL@ hemoglobinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline ; wr242511 @CHEMICAL@ myoglobinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline ; wr242511 @CHEMICAL@ liver toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ 8-[(4-amino-l-methylbutyl)amino]- 5-(l-hexyloxy)-6-methoxy-4-methylquinoline ; wr242511 @CHEMICAL@ kidney toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear hearing loss. Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area (A1) of primate cortex. In A1 of macaque monkeys, low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially. The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear hearing loss. Under anesthesia, the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed, and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques. Following recovery, the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using kanamycin and furosemide. The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone-burst elicited auditory brainstem responses. Three months after deafening, A1 was remapped. Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data. The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies.

"Tremor side effects of salbutamol, quantified by a laser pointer technique. OBJECTIVE: To study tremor side effects of salbutamol an easily applicable, quick and low-priced method is needed. A new method using a commercially available, pen-shaped laser pointer was developed. Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity, reproducibility, reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire. METHODS: Tremor was measured using a laser pointer technique. To determine sensitivity we assessed tremor in 44 patients with obstructive lung disease after administration of cumulative doses of salbutamol. Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target, subdivided in concentric circles, from 5 m distance. The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius. In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 9 a.m., respectively, 1 week later. Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2-kg weight until exhaustion. Inter-observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects. Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers. RESULTS: Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose-dependent way. Within healthy adults no age-dependency could be found (b = 0.262 mm/year; P = 0.72). There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity (r = 0.093; P = 0.53). Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session (P = 0.07). Support of the arm decreased tremor severity, exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly.

"Increased frequency of venous thromboembolism with the combination of docetaxel and thalidomide in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who were treated with docetaxel alone or in combination with thalidomide. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial. SETTING: National Institutes of Health clinical research center. PATIENTS: Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer.

"Intracranial aneurysms and cocaine abuse: analysis of prognostic indicators. OBJECTIVE: The outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with cocaine abuse is reportedly poor. However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome. METHODS: A review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse. Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage, size of the aneurysm, location of the aneurysm, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002). In patients in the study group, all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05). The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine-related aneurysms.

"Anti-epileptic drugs-induced de novo absence seizures. The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin. Despite the underlying diseases, the prognosis for drug-induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs. The gamma-aminobutyric acid-transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy. Because drug-induced de novo absence seizure is rare, pro-absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor. The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure. The possibility of drug-induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in seizure frequency and/or new seizure types appear following a change in drug treatment. By understanding the underlying mechanism of absence epilepsy, we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with epilepsy and prevent drug-induced absence seizures.",carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ absence seizures ; absence epilepsy ; absence seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ vigabatrin @CHEMICAL@ absence seizures ; absence epilepsy ; absence seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. Seven cases of procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented. In four patients, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia. In the remaining three patients, procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter. These patients had Q-T prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. In four patients, the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia. In two patients, the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died. In the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of procainamide therapy, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia did not reoccur. These seven cases demonstrate that procainamide can produce an acquired prolonged Q-T syndrome with polymorphous ventricular tachycardia.",procainamide @CHEMICAL@ ventricular tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Role of activation of bradykinin B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and Hoe-140 (0.1 microM). Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups. These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors.",phenylephrine @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"5-azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver. To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.","5-azacytidine ; 5-azc @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzo[a]-pyrene @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@ n-methyl-n-nitrosourea @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@ 1,2-dimethylhydrazine ; 1,2-dmh @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@ 2-acetylaminofluorene @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@ ccl4 @CHEMICAL@ initiation induced by carcinogens ; initiation of carcinogenic process @DISEASE@ @CID@"

"Remission induction of meningeal leukemia with high-dose intravenous methotrexate. Twenty children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed meningeal disease were treated with a high-dose intravenous methotrexate regimen that was designed to achieve and maintain CSF methotrexate concentrations of 10(-5) mol/L without the need for concomitant intrathecal dosing. The methotrexate was administered as a loading dose of 6,000 mg/m2 for a period of one hour followed by an infusion of 1,200 mg/m2/h for 23 hours. Leucovorin rescue was initiated 12 hours after the end of the infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg/m2 followed by 12 mg/m2 every three hours for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma methotrexate level decreased to less than 1 X 10(-7) mol/L. The mean steady-state plasma and CSF methotrexate concentrations achieved were 1.1 X 10(-3) mol/L and 3.6 X 10(-5) mol/L, respectively. All 20 patients responded to this regimen, 16/20 (80%) achieved a complete remission, and 20% obtained a partial remission. The most common toxicities encountered were transient serum transaminase and bilirubin elevations, neutropenia, and mucositis.

"The interpeduncular nucleus regulates nicotine's effects on free-field activity. Partial lesions were made with kainic acid in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat. Compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field locomotor hypoactivity caused by nicotine (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) nicotine-induced hyperactivity, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity. Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus (p <0.025), but not for tyrosine hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region. We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic depression of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.",dobutamine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial ischemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute liver failure in two patients with regular alcohol consumption ingesting paracetamol at therapeutic dosage. BACKGROUND: The possible role of alcohol in the development of hepatotoxicity associated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is currently debated. CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of alcohol and who developed liver failure within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping alcohol consumption while being treated with 4 g paracetamol/day. A paracetamol serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range. Possible risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity in patients treated with therapeutic doses of paracetamol are discussed. CONCLUSION: In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of alcohol, liver failure is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested. We propose that the paracetamol dose should not exceed 2 g/day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with paracetamol.",paracetamol ; acetaminophen @CHEMICAL@ hepatotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ paracetamol ; acetaminophen @CHEMICAL@ liver failure @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.",simvastatin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ simvastatin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ atazanavir @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ atazanavir @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Phase II trial of vinorelbine in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Treat Cancer Cooperative Group. PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.",vinorelbine ; vnb @CHEMICAL@ granulocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinorelbine ; vnb @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neurotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and toxicity of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for toxicity; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg/m(2) for paclitaxel (97.3%), 117 mg/m(2) for cisplatin (97.3%), and 1378 mg/m(2) for gemcitabine (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months.

The ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine-treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% apraclonidine. Decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically, but not clinically, significant. No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted. Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found. Upper lid retraction was frequently noted. While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance, one subject suffered from mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after instillation of the medication.

"International mexiletine and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial: I. Report on arrhythmia and other findings. Impact Research Group. The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine (Mexitil-Perlongets) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction. The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. There were more deaths in the mexiletine group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups.

"Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine-induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections. Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects. Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens. In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake. The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.",amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120T on the replication of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen-positive and -negative strains. Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests. Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.",hepatitis b virus e antigen ; hbeag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@ hbsag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The effects of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions. The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions was studied in cats. The convulsive threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%. However, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0.8% sevoflurane, indicating a celling effect. There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane. The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane, and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane. However, there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg. Apamin, a selective blocker of calcium-dependent potassium channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects. Apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant.

"Anti-oxidant effects of atorvastatin in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat. 1. Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-) production. Atorvastatin (Ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2- production in various forms of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) downregulation and the increase in O2- in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with Ato (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. Dexamethasone (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with Dex alone, SBP was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001). In the Ato + Dex group, SBP was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14, respectively (P < 0.001), but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.05). Endothelial-dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the Dex + Ato group than in the Dex only group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Aortic superoxide production was lower in the Dex + Ato group compared with the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.0001). 4.

"99mTc-glucarate for detection of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Infarct-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol. A new infarct-avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ. 99mTc-glucarate was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction. Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration. The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys. Thirty minutes after 99mTc-glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats. ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4. The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac infarction.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction ; cardiac infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ extrapyramidal signs @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage. BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.",adriamycin @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin. A prospective study. Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually. Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies. In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. In these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified. Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure. Thus, gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin.",tobramycin ; tobramycin sulfate @CHEMICAL@ renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ gentamicin ; gentamicin sulfate @CHEMICAL@ renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuroprotective action of MPEP, a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats. The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats. Methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects. A single MPEP (5 mg/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine (100 microM). Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature. MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microM) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microM) were devoid of any effect. The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine-induced toxicity. Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5, and with a decrease in hyperthermia.",methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperthermia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl. OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.",desipramine hcl ; desipramine @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ desipramine hcl ; desipramine @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@ cinacalcet hcl ; cinacalcet @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ cinacalcet hcl ; cinacalcet @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.",l-dopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesia ; lid @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pseudo-allergic reactions to corticosteroids: diagnosis and alternatives. Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (Triniol) and dexamethasone (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.",paramethasone @CHEMICAL@ urticaria @DISEASE@ @CID@ paramethasone @CHEMICAL@ conjunctivitis @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ urticaria @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ conjunctivitis @DISEASE@ @CID@

Rare serious complications may occur in some patients, including haemorrhagic pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression, VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and VPA-induced encephalopathy. The typical signs of VPA-induced encephalopathy are impaired consciousness, sometimes marked EEG background slowing, increased seizure frequency, with or without hyperammonemia. There is still no proof of causative effect of VPA in patients with encephalopathy, but only of an association with an assumed causal relation.

While the involvement of metronidazole in the aetiology of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome suggest a possible link between metronidazole treatment and some cases of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.",metronidazole @CHEMICAL@ haemolytic-uraemic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Risk factors of sensorineural hearing loss in preterm infants. Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991, 8 children (1.46%) developed severe progressive and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications. Our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complications. Ototoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ototoxic drugs, particularly aminoglycosides and furosemide. Finally, we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as hearing loss is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe.",aminoglycosides @CHEMICAL@ sensorineural hearing loss @DISEASE@ @CID@ furosemide @CHEMICAL@ sensorineural hearing loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with cimetidine-associated mental confusion. 15 cases of cimetidine-associated mental confusion have been reported. In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (M.S.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no M.S. change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes. These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (P less than 0.05), as well as cimetidine trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram/ml (P less than 0.05). The severity of M.S. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture. The cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratio of cimetidine concentrations was 0.24:1 and indicates that cimetidine passes the blood-brain barrier; it also raises the possibility that M.S. changes are due to blockade of histamine H2-receptors in the central nervous system. Patients likely to have both raised trough-concentrations and mental confusion are those with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction. They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of cimetidine.",cimetidine @CHEMICAL@ confusion @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis. Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.",ethinyl estradiol ; ee @CHEMICAL@ intrahepatic cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Long term audiological evaluation of beta-thalassemic patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of hearing loss in children and young adults with beta-thalassemia major. METHODS: One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study. All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr/dl. Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine (DFO) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg/kg for the following eight years. Patients were followed for 8-14 years. RESULTS: Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), either unilateral or bilateral. No ototoxic factor, other than DFO, was present in any of the patients. Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed. Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal. Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation. CONCLUSION: The findings are indicative of DFO's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment. Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all thalassemic patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse hearing impairment.",desferrioxamine ; dfo @CHEMICAL@ sensorineural hearing loss ; snhl @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Design and analysis of the HYPREN-trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure. Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). All patients recovered.

"Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine-induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells. Azidothymidine (AZT)-induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in AZT-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone. We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3. There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO. Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone. These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.",azidothymidine ; azt @CHEMICAL@ anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Interactive effects of variations in [Na]o and [Ca]o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency. The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ([Na]o and [Ca]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria. Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1.35 mM Ca (N). It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM (LNa), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [Na]o to 78 mM and [Ca]o to 0.675 mM (LNa+LCa) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM plus increasing [Ca]o to 3.6 mM (LNa+HCa). At normal [Na]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [Ca]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [Ca]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%. All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent. Dose-dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa. Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa. The [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N. The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [Na]o than on [Ca]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",verapamil @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Sodium status influences chronic amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in rats. The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. In salt-depleted rats, amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. In contrast, in normal-salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. All rats in the sodium-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. However, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. In conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.",amphotericin b @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity ; nephrotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.

"Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients. Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders.",phenytoin @CHEMICAL@ overdosages ; overdosage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings. BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury. We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.",doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ myocardial damage ; cardiomyopathy ; myocardial cell injury @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (CIPS): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation. Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS.",cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ bone marrow @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ oedema @DISEASE@ @CID@ tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ bone marrow @DISEASE@ @CID@ tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ oedema @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients (ASA groups 3 and 4). The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response. The haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine/propofol/mixtures studied.",propofol @CHEMICAL@ hypotensive @DISEASE@ @CID@ propofol @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ ephedrine @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxyquinolines: clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan. An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects. The full syndrome of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.",clioquinol @CHEMICAL@ encephalopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ clioquinol @CHEMICAL@ optic atrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@ clioquinol @CHEMICAL@ myelopathy ; myelo neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ clioquinol @CHEMICAL@ visual disturbance @DISEASE@ @CID@ clioquinol @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats. BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.",tranexamic acid ; tamca @CHEMICAL@ convulsive ; seizures ; generalized seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.",amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ behavioral cross-sensitization ; hyperactive @DISEASE@ @CID@ sucrose @CHEMICAL@ behavioral cross-sensitization ; hyperactive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"D-penicillamine-induced angiopathy in rats. The effect of high dose D-penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. Pair fed rats served as controls. Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with D-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D-pen, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D-pen treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D-pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.",d-penicillamine ; d-pen @CHEMICAL@ angiopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.",daunorubicin ; dnr @CHEMICAL@ congestive heart failure ; heart failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected birth defects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect). CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects.

"Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens. Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ carcinoma @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ carcinoma of the bladder @DISEASE@ @CID@ alkylating agents @CHEMICAL@ acute nonlymphocytic leukemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ alkylating agents @CHEMICAL@ non-hodgkin's lymphoma @DISEASE@ @CID@ azathioprine @CHEMICAL@ non-hodgkin's lymphoma @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa. Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.",methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ hepatic injury ; hepatitis @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ jaundice @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ hepatomegaly @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ anorexia @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ vomiting @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ abdominal pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ fatty change @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyldopa @CHEMICAL@ cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A phase I/II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for head and neck cancers: preliminary results. Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy. Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted.

"A phase I study of 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin. Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors. Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis. Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours. The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2. Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites.

"Differential effects of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) on pharmacologically-induced seizures. Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane, has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol (PTZ) 3 h after exposure to gamma-HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ-induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma-HCH (Vohland et al. 1981). In this study, the severity of response to other seizure-inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg/kg gamma-HCH. One hour after the administration of gamma-HCH, the activity of seizure-inducing agents was increased, regardless of their mechanism, while 24 h after gamma-HCH a differential response was observed. Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin (PTX) was significantly decreased; however, seizure activity due to 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), bicuculline (BCC), methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), or strychnine (STR) was not different from control. In vitro, gamma-HCH, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H-TBOB binding in mouse whole brain, with IC50 values of 4.6, 404 and 9.4 microM, respectively. MPA, BCC, DMCM, and STR showed no inhibition of 3H-TBOB (t-butyl bicyclo-orthobenzoate) binding at concentrations of 100 micron. The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma-HCH, since the response to only these two seizure-inducing agents is decreased. The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma-HCH may be the GABA-A receptor-linked chloride channel.","ptz ; pentylenetetrazol @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ picrotoxin ; ptx @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ 3-mercaptopropionic acid ; mpa @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ bicuculline ; bcc @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-b-carboline-3-carboxylate ; dmcm @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ strychnine ; str @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.",carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ orbital toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ pain in the ipsilateral eye ; ocular pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ papilledema @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ retinal detachment @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ optic atrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@

CI-921 (NSC 343499; 9-[[2-methoxy-4-[(methylsulphonyl)amino]phenyl]amino] -N,5-dimethyl- 4-acridinecarboxamide) is a topoisomerase II poison with high experimental antitumour activity. It was administered by 15 min infusion to 16 evaluable patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (7 with no prior treatment, 9 patients in relapse following surgery/radiotherapy) at a dose (648 mg/m2 divided over 3 days, repeated every 3 weeks) determined by phase I trial. Patients had a median performance status of 1 (WHO), and median age of 61 years. The histology comprised squamous carcinoma (11), adenocarcinoma (1), mixed histology (2), bronchio-alveolar carcinoma (1) and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma (1).

"Alpha-lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy. The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.",paclitaxel @CHEMICAL@ toxic neurodegenerative cascade @DISEASE@ @CID@ paclitaxel @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy ; peripheral nerve toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ toxic neurodegenerative cascade @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy ; peripheral nerve toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Optimising stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling. Preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion.

"The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man. Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.",cefonicid @CHEMICAL@ anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cefonicid @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cefonicid @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cefazedone @CHEMICAL@ anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cefazedone @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cefazedone @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@

A 3-year-old girl had behavioral deterioration, with hyperkinesis, irritability, and sleeping difficulties after the therapeutic administration of isoniazid. The administration of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptoms. After discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyridoxine. A placebo had no effect, but niacinamide was as effective as pyridoxine. Periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyperkinesis. The level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse. Metabolic studies suggested a block in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.

"A selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist, NRA0160: a preclinical neuropharmacological profile. NRA0160, 5 - [2- ( 4- ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene) piperidin-1-yl) ethyl] - 4 -(4-fluorophenyl) thiazole-2-carboxamide, has a high affinity for human cloned dopamine D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7 receptors, with Ki values of 0.5, 0.9 and 2.7 nM, respectively. NRA0160 is over 20,000fold more potent at the dopamine D4.2 receptor compared with the human cloned dopamine D2L receptor. NRA0160 has negligible affinity for the human cloned dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=39 nM), rat serotonin (5-HT)2A receptors (Ki=180 nM) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor (Ki=237 nM). NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine (MAP) in mice. NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized MAP-induced stereotyped behavior in mice, although their effects did not exceed 50% inhibition, even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly induced catalepsy in rats, although their effects did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given.

"HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Current clinical experience. Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best-known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients, 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more, and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients, of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more. Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months. Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30% and in LDL-cholesterol of 40% in clinical studies. Modest increases in HDL-cholesterol levels of about 10% are also reported. Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences. Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term (up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential. One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued. Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients. Myopathy, associated in some cases with myoglobinuria, and in 2 cases with transient renal failure, has been rarely reported with lovastatin, especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin, gemfibrozil or niacin.

The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist.

"Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia. Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed.

"Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting, without increasing pain, after sevoflurane for day surgery. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.",fentanyl @CHEMICAL@ postoperative nausea and vomiting @DISEASE@ @CID@ fentanyl @CHEMICAL@ respiratory depression @DISEASE@ @CID@ fentanyl @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ fentanyl @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Renal Fanconi syndrome and myopathy after liver transplantation: drug-related mitochondrial cytopathy?

Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post-transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance got worse. Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow-up. Fanconi syndrome, as well as myopathy, is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA.

"Antipsychotic-like profile of thioperamide, a selective H3-receptor antagonist in mice. Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg i.c.v.) could partially reverse such effects of THP (3.75 mg/kg i.p.). Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP. Such an effect was, however, reversed in presence of RAMH. THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine-induced climbing in mice. Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H(3)-receptors.

In this report we describe the case of a 37-year-old white woman with Ebstein's anomaly, who developed a rare syndrome called platypnea-orthodeoxia, characterized by massive right-to-left interatrial shunting with transient profound hypoxia and cyanosis. This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose. This drug caused biventricular dysfunction, due to its negative inotropic effect, and hypotension, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect. These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right-to-left shunting.

"A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR-2721 (amifostine) for metastatic breast carcinoma: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E8188). BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%.

"The selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory deficiency in the rat. Antagonists at serotonin type 6 (5-HT(6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory. Although the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The present study sought to characterize the cognitive-enhancing effects of the 5-HT(6) antagonist Ro4368554 (3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)1H-indole) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic (scopolamine pretreatment) and a serotonergic- (tryptophan (TRP) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate. Initial testing in a time-dependent forgetting task employing a 24-h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition (at 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.), whereas Ro4368554 was inactive. Both, Ro4368554 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and metrifonate (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). In conclusion, although Ro4368554 did not improve a time-related retention deficit, it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by Ro4368554 and, possibly, other 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists.",scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ memory deficiency ; memory deficits ; memory deficit @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation. Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.","dfu ; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5h)-furanon @CHEMICAL@ intrauterine growth retardation @DISEASE@ @CID@ piroxicam @CHEMICAL@ intrauterine growth retardation @DISEASE@ @CID@ piroxicam @CHEMICAL@ increase of external and skeletal variations @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled-seizures in mice. Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments. The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling). Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures in male, Swiss-Webster mice. Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg cocaine for 5 days. All of these positive GABA(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling. Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling. These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Kidney function and morphology after short-term combination therapy with cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat. BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated.",cyclosporine a ; csa @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@ tacrolimus ; fk506 @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@ sirolimus ; srl @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the brain damage following ischemic stroke. Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke. We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage, in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus. Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan (30 micrograms h-1) or vehicle. The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks. Fucoidan-treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution, had larger hematomas, and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days. They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following hemorrhage and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test. Acute white matter edema and eventual neuronal loss in the striatum adjacent to the hematoma did not differ between the two groups. Investigation of more specific anti-inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in intracerebral hemorrhage.",fucoidan @CHEMICAL@ impaired blood clotting ; hemodilution @DISEASE@ @CID@ fucoidan @CHEMICAL@ white matter edema @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Hepatic reactions associated with ketoconazole in the United Kingdom. Ketoconazole was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981. By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug, including five deaths. An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16, including three deaths, were probably related to treatment with the drug. Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be so, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9, with hepatotoxicity being more common in women. The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days. None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 (63%); the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis. Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury.",ketoconazole @CHEMICAL@ hepatotoxicity ; hepatocellular injury ; hepatitis ; hepatic injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ ketoconazole @CHEMICAL@ jaundice @DISEASE@ @CID@ ketoconazole @CHEMICAL@ cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1-induced hypotension and haemodilution on human hepatic function. Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A (n = 10) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone, those in group B (n = 10) to haemodilution alone and those in group C (n = 10) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution. Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%. Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, aceto-acetate/3-hydroxybutyrate) and clinical hepatic function parameters. AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B. In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation. The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of PGE1-induced hypotension and moderate haemodilution would cause impairment of hepatic function.",prostaglandin e1 ; pge1 @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ prostaglandin e1 ; pge1 @CHEMICAL@ impairment of hepatic function @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease: filling the bench-to-bedside gap. Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias. Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa-induced dyskinesias, their pathogenesis is still unclear. In recent years, evidence from animal models of Parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements. Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, dopamine receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesias ; dyskinetic movements @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats. BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were monitored using Racine's seizure severity scale. All of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ epilepsy ; epileptic @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus ; se @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously. Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured. Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed. Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats. Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function. The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats. The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA). VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals. Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin. INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of ""acute hepatitis of unknown origin,"" that occurred after telithromycin usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin.",telithromycin @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis ; hepatotoxicity ; hepatic injury ; toxic hepatitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure. BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.",spironolactone @CHEMICAL@ renal insufficiency ; renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ spironolactone @CHEMICAL@ hyperkalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment. BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.",cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxic ; renal dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@ tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxic ; renal dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stroke. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between nimodipine-induced reduction in blood pressure (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DBP reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. For low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive. These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine.",nimodipine @CHEMICAL@ reduction in blood pressure ; bp reduction ; reduction in systolic bp ; dbp reduction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine. BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine. However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs.",prilocaine @CHEMICAL@ transient neurologic symptoms ; tnss @DISEASE@ @CID@ lidocaine @CHEMICAL@ transient neurologic symptoms ; tnss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The role of nicotine in smoking-related cardiovascular disease. Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease. Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ cardiovascular disease @DISEASE@ @CID@ nicotine @CHEMICAL@ atherosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of venlafaxine overdose. CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt. After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure.

"Effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus. The effect of nifedipine on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving tacrolimus was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996. Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine. The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients. Nifedipine significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum creatinine levels at 6 and 12 months.

"Composition of gall bladder stones associated with octreotide: response to oral ursodeoxycholic acid. Octreotide, an effective treatment for acromegaly, induces gall bladder stones in 13-60% of patients. Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones. Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight. In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units (values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones). Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. All six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (SEM) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling. Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up. After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich. This corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). In conclusion, octreotide induced gall stones are generally small, multiple, and cholesterol rich although, in common with spontaneous gall stone disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium.",octreotide @CHEMICAL@ gall bladder stones ; gall stones ; gall stone ; gall stone disease @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2-chloroprocaine-CE, bupivacaine, and low pH normal saline in dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2-chloroprocaine-CE in experimental animals. The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evaluated. The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows: 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine (N = 15), 2-chloroprocaine-CE (N = 20), low pH normal saline (pH 3.0) (N = 20), or normal saline (N = 10). Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2-chloroprocaine-CE seven (35%) developed hind-limb paralysis. None of the animals that received bupivacaine, normal saline, or normal saline titrated to a pH 3.0 developed hind-limb paralysis. Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2-chloroprocaine-CE, 13 showed subpial necrosis; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal.

"Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma. A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) bladder tumors. Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year. The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects. In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study. No systemic side-effects were observed. Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months). Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease. Of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%). Of these recurrences, 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions. In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained tumor-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period. Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped. The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both.",adriamycin @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy. Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as indomethacin. Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac, owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis. We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration. In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac. As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia. These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified.",sulindac @CHEMICAL@ hyperkalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ indomethacin @CHEMICAL@ hyperkalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen-induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment. To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen-induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine (3 mg/kg of body weight). One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly. Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells. Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased. These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules. At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls. The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae. Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells. However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells. An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.",estrogen @CHEMICAL@ prolactinomas ; prolactinoma @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in rats. The half-life (t1/2) of cocaine is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as seizures and strokes, can occur hours after exposure. This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae. We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), to cause seizures. Two separate equimolar doses (0.2 and 0.4 mumol) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats. Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures. BE-Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine. Whereas cocaine-induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression. BE-Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine-injected animals without seizures. The finding that cocaine- and BE-induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine-induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite, BE.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzoylecgonine ; be @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Protection against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by LY274614, an excitatory amino acid antagonist. LY274614, 3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr oisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 (a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). The protective effect of LY274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg/kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by LY274614. The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.",amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ neurotoxicity ; neurotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Reversal by phenylephrine of the beneficial effects of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy. Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). SigmaST, the sum of ST-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (P less than 0.02) with intravenous nitroglycerin. Subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmaST (P less than 0.05).

"Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features CaCl2-induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model. PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation. METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.",cacl2 ; calcium chloride ; cacl(2) @CHEMICAL@ thoracic aortic aneurysm ; taa @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Long-term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel. Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (PAC), although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC-induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. Forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P). Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G. However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation (P = 0.011). Also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (G: 7/23 = 30.4%; P: 6/20 = 30%).

"Testosterone-dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Blood pressure (BP) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS), high-salt (HS) diet increases BP more in males than females. In contrast to the systemic renin-angiotensin system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS-induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury. On a low-salt (LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females. HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration. Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet. Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet. HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration. Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP, renal injury, and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet.

"Prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine-mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding. Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia. The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia. We report that prenatally protein deprived (PD) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood. These differences were not observed during puberty. No changes in haloperidol-induced catalepsy or MK-801-induced locomotion were seen following PD. In addition, PD female rats showed increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. PD female rats also showed increased (3)H-haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum. No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in cortex.

Because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome, many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years. Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de novo.

"Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol. Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido. Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.",sulpiride @CHEMICAL@ hyperprolactinemic ; hyperprolactinemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.",ritonavir @CHEMICAL@ premature atherosclerosis ; atherosclerotic lesion @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles seizure-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats. PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mice. Seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains. Chromosome substitution strains (CSS), in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain (donor) has been transferred onto a second strain (host) by repeated backcrossing, may be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to seizure susceptibility. QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes. We report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) x A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures. Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice. B6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to A/J mice. The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype. Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice. CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18.

"Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine. Mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell death, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (FR) production. Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits. In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups. We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA-encoded subunit of CCO (CCO-I) or a relative decrease in CCO-I when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (CCO-IV and SDH-fp). No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry. Although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO-I, and in CCO activity.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ temporal lobe epilepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. In the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).",cyclosporine @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic microangiopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine overdose. Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon. In contrast, reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare. A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis. Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision.",epinephrine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial stunning @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Urinary bladder cancer in Wegener's granulomatosis: risks and relation to cyclophosphamide. OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener's granulomatosis.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ urinary bladder cancer ; bladder cancer @DISEASE@ @CID@
"L-arginine transport in humans with cortisol-induced hypertension. A deficient L-arginine-nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol-induced hypertension. We investigate whether abnormalities in L-arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency. Eight healthy men were recruited. Hydrocortisone acetate (50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5-day fixed-salt diet (150 mmol/d). Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart. Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period. L-arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with L-arginine (1 to 300 micromol/L), incorporating 100 nmol/L [3H]-l-arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C. Forearm [3H]-L-arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [3H]-L-arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi/min for 80 minutes. Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of L-arginine extraction. Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase (323+/-43 to 1082+/-245 mmol/L, P<0.05). Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg. Neither L-arginine transport into mononuclear cells (placebo vs active, 26.3+/-3.6 vs 29.0+/-2.1 pmol/10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an l-arginine concentration of 300 micromol/L) nor L-arginine extraction in the forearm (at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904+/-434 962 vs 2 013 910+/-770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by cortisol treatment; ie, that L-arginine uptake is not affected by short-term cortisol treatment. We conclude that cortisol-induced increases in blood pressure are not associated with abnormalities in the l-arginine transport system.",hydrocortisone acetate @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; increases in blood pressure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients. Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.",tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ white matter abnormalities @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Sequential observations of exencephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system: analysis of the mechanism of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly. Anencephaly has been suggested to develop from exencephaly; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear. We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos. We observed the exencephaly induced by 5-azacytidine at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5. We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly. However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period. To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5. It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13.5. Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13.5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18.5. From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head. These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and/or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly.",5-azacytidine @CHEMICAL@ anencephaly @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute cocaine-induced seizures: differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains. Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of cocaine. Cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses (50-100 mg/kg) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes. Seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus, latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping bouncing seizure. A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A/J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL/6J most resistant. DBA/2J, BALB/cByJ and NZW/LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity. EEG recordings were made in SJL, A/J and C57BL/6J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior. Additionally, levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains. Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on cocaine-induced seizures.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@

We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 (tacrolimus) therapy. In both cases, discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, corticosteroids, aspirin, and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA. In one patient, reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA. FK506-associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication.

"Mouse strain-dependent effect of amantadine on motility and brain biogenic amines. The effect of amantadine hydrochloride, injected i.p. in 6 increments of 100 mg/kg each over 30 hr, on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice. These were the albino Sprague-Dawley ICR and BALB/C, the black C57BL/6 and the brown CDF-I mouse strains. Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility. The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB/C mice being the most sensitive. Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB/C mice being the least sensitive. The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug-free period following the fourth amantadine treatment. Readministration of amantadine, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB/C mice where suppression of motility occurred. Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB/C mice compared to saline control. Conversely, brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB/C mice. The results suggest a strain-dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used. The BALB/C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine. The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O-methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amantadine in the BALB/C mice.",amantadine ; amantadine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ suppression of motility ; behavioral depression @DISEASE@ @CID@
"No enhancement by phenobarbital of the hepatocarcinogenicity of a choline-devoid diet in the rat. An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of phenobarbital in a choline-devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet. Groups of 5-week old male Fischer-344 rats were fed for 7-25 months semipurified choline-devoid or choline-supplemented diets, containing or not 0.06% phenobarbital. No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas developed in rats fed the plain choline-supplemented diet, while one preneoplastic nodule and one hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two rats fed the same diet containing phenobarbital. The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of hepatocellular carcinomas was 10% and 37%, respectively, in rats fed the plain choline-devoid diet, and 17% and 30%, in rats fed the phenobarbital-containing choline-devoid diet. The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the choline-devoid diet by phenobarbital.

"Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina. The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group). Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.",methylergonovine @CHEMICAL@ coronary spasm @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Dobutamine stress echocardiography: a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy. To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin, a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects. Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory failure. Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits. When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level. These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure, pharmacologic agents, particularly aminophylline, may play a significant role.",aminophylline @CHEMICAL@ ventricular fibrillation @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Case report: acute unintentional carbachol intoxication. INTRODUCTION: Intoxications with carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260.

Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (69.8%) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine/caffeine (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were 31.4% with rizatriptan and 15.3% with ergotamine/caffeine. Both active treatments were well tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or = 5% in one group) after rizatriptan and ergotamine/caffeine, respectively, were dizziness (6.7 and 5.3%), nausea (4.2 and 8.5%) and somnolence (5.5 and 2.3%).",rizatriptan @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ rizatriptan @CHEMICAL@ dizziness @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy. Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy (characterized by renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and usually thrombocytopenia) after treatment with cisplatin, bleomycin, and a vinca alkaloid. One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, three the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. Because each patient was tumor-free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome, the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug-induced bone marrow suppression.",cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ hemolytic-uremic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ bleomycin @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura @DISEASE@ @CID@ bleomycin @CHEMICAL@ hemolytic-uremic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ bleomycin @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinca alkaloid @CHEMICAL@ thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinca alkaloid @CHEMICAL@ hemolytic-uremic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ vinca alkaloid @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan. PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock.

"Bradykinin receptors antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in vincristine and streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia in chemotherapy and diabetic neuropathy rat model. PURPOSE: The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase (L-NOArg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (L-NIL; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (7-NI; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] bradykinin (HOE 140; 70 nmol/kg ip) or des Arg10 HOE 140 (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic (streptozotocin-induced) and toxic (vincristine-induced) neuropathy was investigated. METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto. RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia. Pretreatment with L-NOArg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140. It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine. Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des-Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy. In streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway. Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital care.",vincristine @CHEMICAL@ hyperalgesia ; diabetic hyperalgesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ vincristine @CHEMICAL@ toxic (vincristine-induced) neuropathy ; toxic neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin @CHEMICAL@ hyperalgesia ; diabetic hyperalgesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin @CHEMICAL@ diabetic neuropathy ; diabetic (streptozotocin-induced) neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients. Routine EKG monitoring during infusional cyclophosphamide did not predict CHF development.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ congestive heart failure ; chf @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures. Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures. Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add-on. Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine. Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment. Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.",carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ absence seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ myoclonic jerks @DISEASE@ @CID@ vigabatrin @CHEMICAL@ absence seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Hemolytic anemia associated with the use of omeprazole. Omeprazole is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell. It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, reflux esophagitis, and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Although clinical experience with omeprazole is still limited, many controlled studies have established the short-term safety of this drug. We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole: hemolytic anemia. The patient developed weakness, lethargy, and shortness of breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole. Two weeks after the initiation of therapy, her hematocrit had decreased from 44.1% to 20.4%, and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect bilirubin. After she discontinued the omeprazole, her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal. The mechanism by which omeprazole caused the patient's hemolytic anemia is uncertain, but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect.",omeprazole @CHEMICAL@ hemolytic anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ omeprazole @CHEMICAL@ lethargy @DISEASE@ @CID@ omeprazole @CHEMICAL@ shortness of breath @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The use and toxicity of didanosine (ddI) in HIV antibody-positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) One hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to zidovudine (AZT) received didanosine (ddI) to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day. Patient response was assessed using changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count, HIV p24 antigen, weight, and quality of life. Seventy patients developed major opportunistic infections whilst on therapy; this was the first AIDS diagnosis in 17. Only minor changes in CD4+ lymphocyte subset count were observed in AIDS patients, although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease. Of those positive for p24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67% showed a positive response, and this was most likely in those with CD4+ lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm3. A positive weight response was seen in 16% of patients. Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life. Adverse reactions possibly attributable to didanosine were common. The most common side-effect was diarrhoea, which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12 patients and pancreatitis in six. Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without abdominal pain. Seven patients developed glucose tolerance curves characteristic of diabetes but these were mild, did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing didanosine.",didanosine ; ddi @CHEMICAL@ diarrhoea @DISEASE@ @CID@ didanosine ; ddi @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ didanosine ; ddi @CHEMICAL@ pancreatitis @DISEASE@ @CID@ didanosine ; ddi @CHEMICAL@ glucose tolerance curves @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia? BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis. We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation. Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy.",sunitinib @CHEMICAL@ hemolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ sorafenib @CHEMICAL@ hemolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate. Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine. Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ memory impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@ cocaine @CHEMICAL@ learning impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier PG-9. The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate [(+/-)-PG-9] (10-40 mg kg-1 s.c.; 30-60 mg kg-1 p.o.; 10-30 mg kg-1 i.v.; 10-30 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot-plate, abdominal-constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. (+/-)-PG-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished. The antinociception produced by (+/-)-PG-9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the M1-selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3, but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone, the gamma-aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3-aminopropyl-diethoxy-methyl-phosphinic acid, the H3 agonist R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, the D2 antagonist quinpirole, the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride, the 5-hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine. Based on these data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-PG-9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. (+/-)-PG-9 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and dicyclomine (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test. Affinity profiles of (+/-)-PG-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+/-)-PG-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels. In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range, (+/-)-PG-9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota-rod test and Animex apparatus.",dicyclomine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia ; amnesic @DISEASE@ @CID@ scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia ; amnesic @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Clinical experiences in an open and a double-blind trial. A total of sixty patients were trated with bromperidol first in open conditions (20 patients), then on a double blind basis (40 patients) with haloperidol as the reference substance. The open study lasted for four weeks; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets. The daily dose (initial dose: 1 mg; mean dose at the end of the trial: 4.47 mg) was always administered in one single dose. Nineteen patients finished the trial, and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good. These results were confirmed by statistical analysis. Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms; no other side effects were observed. The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects. In the double blind study with haloperidol, both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group.

"Curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats. The antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use. The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. Vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs.",phenobarbitone @CHEMICAL@ cognitive dysfunction ; cognitive impairment ; impairment of learning and memory ; deterioration of cognitive functions @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ cognitive dysfunction ; cognitive impairment ; impairment of learning and memory ; deterioration of cognitive functions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate protects the piriform cortex in the pilocarpine status epilepticus model. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa-beta. Both, production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices. The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model. Treatment with 150 mg/kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. Administration of 50 mg/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Low-dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex. A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and PDTC-treated rats following status epilepticus. In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss. These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in seizure-associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus. However, future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ neuronal damage ; neuronal loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety profile of a nicotine lozenge compared with that of nicotine gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions: a 12-week, randomized, open-label study. BACKGROUND: Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25% to 27% more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum. The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label-restricted diseases. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adult smokers with heart disease, hypertension not controlled by medication, and/or diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the 4-mg nicotine lozenge or 4-mg nicotine gum. Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use. RESULTS: Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum (safety population). The majority were women (52.7%). Patients' mean age was 53.9 years, their mean weight was 193.9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day at baseline. Five hundred fifty-three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for > or =4 days per week during the first 2 weeks (evaluable population). The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge. The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively). Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum. The most common adverse events were nausea (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), hiccups (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and headache (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6). Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups. Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study. The majority of patients (>60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline.

"Development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) present a major problem for the long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs. Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP-induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs. Monkeys with acute (short-term) MPTP exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration. In contrast, monkeys with long-term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration). All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug. These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop LIDs in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of LIDs.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesias ; lids ; dyskinesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ mptp @CHEMICAL@ parkinsonism @DISEASE@ @CID@

METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis, fever, and glomerulonephritis developed. Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old woman with Graves' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis, which was confirmed by biopsy. Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1-month course of prednisone, which alleviated her symptoms.

"Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta-carboline-induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA(A) receptor ligands. Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), an inverse agonist of the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. Our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA(A) receptor. We measured diazepam-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures after i.p. injections.

"Analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine in cancer patients on morphine therapy: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study. Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic. Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, such as ketamine, may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study. Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale; nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and dry mouth, using a scale from 0 to 3 (not at all, slight, a lot, awful); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (0-30); and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs (T0) and after 30 minutes (T30), 60 minutes (T60), 120 minutes (T120), and 180 minutes (T180). Ketamine, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses. This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses. Hallucinations occurred in 4 patients, and an unpleasant sensation (""empty head"") was also reported by 2 patients. These episodes reversed after the administration of diazepam 1 mg intravenously. Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with ketamine in both groups and were more marked with ketamine 0.50 mg/kg. A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0.50 mg/kg of ketamine. Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic pain. However, the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account, especially when using higher doses. This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged ketamine administration.",ketamine @CHEMICAL@ hallucinations @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Endocrine screening in 1,022 men with erectile dysfunction: clinical significance and cost-effective strategy. PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and/or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.",testosterone @CHEMICAL@ low sexual desire @DISEASE@ @CID@

Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline, Group L, 2 ml, lidocaine 2% (40 mg) and Group T, 2 ml thiopentone 2.5% (50 mg). Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) 5-15 sec after commencing propofol administration using an infusion pump (rate 1000 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Loss of consciousness occurred in 60-90 sec. Visual analogue scores (mean +/- SD) during induction were lower in Groups L (3.3 +/- 2.5) and T (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in Group C (5.6 +/- 2.3); P = 0.0031. The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001). Recovery room discharge times were similar: C (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); L 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); T (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). Assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose propofol anaesthesia again. We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity.",propofol @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Comparison of i.v. glycopyrrolate and atropine in the prevention of bradycardia and arrhythmias following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children. The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children, was studied. A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of glycopyrrolate and atropine. A frequency of bradycardia of 50% was noted in the control group, but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs. Bradycardia (defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min-1) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used. It is recommended that either glycopyrrolate 10 micrograms kg-1 or atropine 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia, in children, if the repeated administration of suxamethonium is anticipated.",suxamethonium @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen. A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). Acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown.",caffeine @CHEMICAL@ convulsions ; seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrezol @CHEMICAL@ convulsions ; seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular hypertension. The effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension. Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril-treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine-treated (n = 10). Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment. In contrast, in the nitrendipine-treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls. Furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine-treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). In addition, glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the enalapril-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the hypertensive controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",nitrendipine @CHEMICAL@ nephrosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ nitrendipine @CHEMICAL@ albuminuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Treatment of tinnitus by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine (lidocaine) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes. Idiopathic subjective tinnitus (IST) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies. This paper presents the results of treating IST by intratympanic instillation of lignocaine (lidocaine) 2 per cent through a grommet, for five weekly courses. Fifty-two patients suffering from intractable tinnitus entered this therapeutic trial, but only nine finished all five courses. In one patient, the tinnitus was almost completely abolished, but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one. We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs, acupuncture and biofeedback, with disappointing results. Patients should be warned about the side effects of vertigo and vomiting, which subsides gradually with every new instillation, and that the tinnitus may not disappear but will be alleviated, enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life.",lignocaine ; lidocaine @CHEMICAL@ vertigo @DISEASE@ @CID@ lignocaine ; lidocaine @CHEMICAL@ vomiting @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Perhexiline maleate and peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris. In 24 patients with this complication, the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a demyelinating disorder. Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.",perhexiline maleate @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ perhexiline maleate @CHEMICAL@ demyelinating disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of humoral modulators of morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice. The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice was studied. The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine-HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice. The morphine-induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine. In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine. Pretreatment of mice with alpha-methyltyrosine (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of morphine. On the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity. The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain. And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses. It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of morphine in rats.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ increase in locomotor activity ; hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@ scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ increase in locomotor activity ; hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension in the rat. -Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.",fk 506 ; tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@

"The effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual dysfunction induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: a double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained-release (SR) on male sexual dysfunction (SD) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as SD is a common side-effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI. The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the bupropion and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD, type of SSRI used and age. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs. These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion.",selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ; ssri ; ssris @CHEMICAL@ erectile dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBSAG) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation. In this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine. The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT. Two groups were compared in this study. The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment. The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. The outcomes were compared for both groups. Of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established hepatitis. Twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis. In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group; 154:64 (p < 0.32). Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT.",hepatitis-b surface antigen ; hbsag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b ; hbv infection @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats. Rg1, as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng, could ameliorate spatial learning impairment. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect. Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine (10 mg/kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and Rg1 (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days. Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze. The results showed that rats treated with Morphine/Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency. By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that Rg1 restored the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats. The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or morphine/Rg1-treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK801. We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine-inhibited LTP. This effect is NMDA receptor dependent.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ impairment of learning ; learning impairment @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain. AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin. BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented. DESIGN: This study was designed as within-subject, quasi-experimental research. METHOD: The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered. Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site. Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection. Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop-watch was used to time the pain period. Data were analysed using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation. RESULTS: The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection. It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30-second injection. Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30-second injection than for the 10-second injection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin. This study should be repeated on a larger sample. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When administering subcutaneous heparin injections, it is important to extend the duration of the injection.",heparin @CHEMICAL@ bruising @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats. Reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (TD) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.",reserpine @CHEMICAL@ orofacial dyskinesia ; tardive dyskinesia ; td ; orofacial diskinesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ orofacial dyskinesia ; tardive dyskinesia ; td ; orofacial diskinesia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"The effect of treatment with gum Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats: a preliminary study. In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum Arabic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin (GM) nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated with the vehicle (2 mL/kg of distilled water and 5% w/v cellulose, 10 days), gum Arabic (2 mL/kg of a 10% w/v aqueous suspension of gum Arabic powder, orally for 10 days), or gum Arabic concomitantly with GM (80mg/kg/day intramuscularly, during the last six days of the treatment period). Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections. The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM), and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM-induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose. It could be inferred that gum Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity.

"Visual hallucinations associated with zonisamide. Zonisamide is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures. Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased. All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were abnormal. During monitoring, visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events. None of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event. The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zonisamide. With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur. Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect.

"GLEPP1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat PAN nephrosis. A marker of acute podocyte injury. Glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes. This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN, 20 mg/100g BW). Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126). At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005). This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001). In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline. By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal. We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN. GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.",pan ; puromycin aminonucleoside @CHEMICAL@ nephrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ pan ; puromycin aminonucleoside @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia: report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature. In this study, three Chinese patients with ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed. We attempted to find underlying similarities, evaluate the risk factors, and identify appropriate treatment for this complication. All but one of the patients were over 60 years old, and the 6 who died were all older than 65. Therefore, old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication. Agranulocytosis occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine, so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended. There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow suppression. Treatment for ticlopidine-induced aplastic anemia with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect. The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died, should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously.",ticlopidine @CHEMICAL@ aplastic anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ ticlopidine @CHEMICAL@ agranulocytosis @DISEASE@ @CID@

Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial. Similarly, pre-test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine-induced amnesia, but not significantly; and pre-test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide-induced amnesia.

"Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents. These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. Dopamine turnover ratios (DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. However, apomorphine-induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments.

"The risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine-dependent patients in Malaysia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine-induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and methamphetamine-induced psychosis was also studied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia. Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records. RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms. Co-morbid major depressive disorder (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors. Major depressive disorder (OR=2.870, CI=1.154-7.142) and antisocial personality disorder (OR=3.299, 95 CI=1.375-7.914) were the only factors associated with current psychosis. CONCLUSION: There was a high risk of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. It was associated with co-morbid affective disorder, antisocial personality, and heavy methamphetamine use. It is recommended that all cases of methamphetamine dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms.",methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ psychosis ; psychotic symptoms @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ bipolar disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine @CHEMICAL@ antisocial personality disorder ; antisocial personality @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cerebellar sensory processing alterations impact motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson's disease: clues from dyskinetic patients. The plasticity of primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) is severely impaired. We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS). This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation. This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity. The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known. To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1. These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinetic ; dyskinesias ; lids ; abnormal involuntary movements @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The function of P2X3 receptor and NK1 receptor antagonists on cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis in rats. METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.9% saline (4 ml/kg); the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with CYP (150 mg/kg); and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with CYP with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, Suramin and GR 82334. Spontaneous pain behaviors following the administration of CYP were observed. Urodynamic parameters, bladder pressure-volume curve, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), were recorded. Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide treatment increased the spontaneous pain behaviors scores. The incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group (X(2) = 7.619, P = 0.007) and control group (X(2) = 13.755, P = 0.000). MCC in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups (P < 0.01). Histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats' bladder included edema, vasodilation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In model group, the expression of P2X3 receptor increased in urothelium and suburothelium, and NK1 receptor increased in suburothelium, while the expression of them in intervention group was lower. CONCLUSIONS: In CYP-induced cystitis, the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors increased in urothelium and/or suburothelium.

"Bortezomib and dexamethasone as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: analysis of long-term clinical outcomes. Bortezomib (bort)-dexamethasone (dex) is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). This retrospective study investigated the combination of bort (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks) and dex (20 mg on the day of and the day after bort) as salvage treatment in 85 patients with R/R MM after prior autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had received immunomodulatory drugs included in some line of therapy before bort-dex. The median number of bort-dex cycles was 6, up to a maximum of 12 cycles. On an intention-to-treat basis, 55 % of the patients achieved at least partial response, including 19 % CR and 35 % achieved at least very good partial response. Median durations of response, time to next therapy and treatment-free interval were 8, 11.2, and 5.1 months, respectively. The most relevant adverse event was peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in 78 % of the patients (grade II, 38 %; grade III, 21 %) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6 %. With a median follow up of 22 months, median time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.9, 8.7, and 22 months, respectively. Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving bort-dex a single line of prior therapy.

"Pubertal exposure to Bisphenol A increases anxiety-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice. The negative effects of Bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in anxiety-like behavior. This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following BPA exposure during puberty. On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg BPA/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test. In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that anxiety-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to BPA. AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with BPA compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our findings showed that pubertal BPA exposure increased anxiety-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced anxiety-like behaviors.",bisphenol a ; bpa @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats.

"Real-world data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the ""real world"" (RW), according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition. We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.",lenalidomide ; rd @CHEMICAL@ myelosuppression @DISEASE@ @CID@ lenalidomide ; rd @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ lenalidomide ; rd @CHEMICAL@ deep vein thrombosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ myelosuppression @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ deep vein thrombosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The cytogenetic action of ifosfamide, mesna, and their combination on peripheral rabbit lymphocytes: an in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic study. Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard, administrated as an antineoplasmic agent. It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. This side effect of IFO raises the requirement for the co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect. IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro. Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI) and Mitotic Index were recorded. Mesna's action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone. In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes. Mesna significantly reduces IFO's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.",ifosfamide ; ifo @CHEMICAL@ hemorrhagic @DISEASE@ @CID@ ifosfamide ; ifo @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysians with Parkinson's disease. Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. The median disease duration was 6 (7) years. Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years. There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups. Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations. Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose.

"An investigation of the pattern of kidney injury in HIV-positive persons exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: an examination of a large population database (MHRA database). The potential for tenofovir to cause a range of kidney syndromes has been established from mechanistic and randomised clinical trials. However, the exact pattern of kidney involvement is still uncertain. We undertook a descriptive analysis of Yellow Card records of 407 HIV-positive persons taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen and submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with suspected kidney adverse effects. Reports that satisfy defined criteria were classified as acute kidney injury, kidney tubular dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome. Of the 407 Yellow Card records analysed, 106 satisfied criteria for TDF-related kidney disease, of which 53 (50%) had features of kidney tubular dysfunction, 35 (33%) were found to have features of glomerular dysfunction and 18 (17%) had Fanconi syndrome. The median TDF exposure was 316 days (interquartile range 120-740). The incidence of hospitalisation for TDF kidney adverse effects was high, particularly amongst patients with features of Fanconi syndrome. The pattern of kidney syndromes in this population series mirrors that reported in randomised clinical trials.

"Incidence of postoperative delirium is high even in a population without known risk factors. PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a recognized complication in populations at risk. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early postoperative delirium in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery. The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used. METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures. Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions. Patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure. Early postoperative delirium incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models. RESULTS: According to the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale, 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early postoperative delirium. The use of thiopentone was significantly associated with an eight-fold-higher risk for delirium compared to propofol (57.1% vs. 7.1%, RR = 8.0, X2 = 4.256; df = 1; 0.05 < p < 0.02).

"A single neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine induces a long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice. Methamphetamine (METH) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal. However, it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of METH also causes a long-lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits. Thus, we now assessed the depressive-like behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high METH dose (30 mg/kg, i.p.). METH did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task. However, METH significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post-administration. This depressive-like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration. In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression--astroglial dysfunction--was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of METH induces long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis.",methamphetamine ; meth @CHEMICAL@ depressive ; depressive symptoms ; depression @DISEASE@ @CID@
Linezolid-induced optic neuropathy. Many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects. This is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect. We describe a case of progressive loss of vision associated with linezolid therapy. A 45-year-old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second-line anti-tuberculous drugs including linezolid and ethambutol for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) presented to us with painless progressive loss of vision in both eyes. Color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed optic disc edema in both eyes. Ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy was suspected and tablet ethambutol was withdrawn. Deterioration of vision occurred despite withdrawal of ethambutol. Discontinuation of linezolid resulted in marked improvement of vision.

"Resuscitation with lipid, epinephrine, or both in levobupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity in newborn piglets. BACKGROUND: The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, epinephrine, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). METHODS: Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST.

"Incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients: a retrospective cohort analysis. BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with end-stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. The impact of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count exceeded 100,000/uL in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding HIT II, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is, with about 1.95%, rare. For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.",heparin @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia type ii ; thrombocytopenia ; hit type ii ; hit ii ; hit @DISEASE@ @CID@

Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ie, ST-segment elevation, T wave inversions, and pathologic Q waves). We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity.

"Depression, impulsiveness, sleep, and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). RATIONALE: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse. Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure. CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.","3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ; mdma ; ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ depression @DISEASE@ @CID@ 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ; mdma ; ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ impulsiveness @DISEASE@ @CID@ 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ; mdma ; ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ sleep disturbance @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Association of common genetic variants of HOMER1 gene with levodopa adverse effects in Parkinson's disease patients. Levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for Parkinson's disease, but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and visual hallucinations. HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission, which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications. This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy. A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were investigated. Patients were genotyped for rs4704559, rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays. The rs4704559 G allele was associated with a lower prevalence of dyskinesia (prevalence ratio (PR)=0.615, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.426-0.887, P=0.009) and visual hallucinations (PR=0.515, 95% CI 0.295-0.899, P=0.020).

"Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver. INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism. Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon. Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg). The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed. Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL. Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript. Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon-induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript.

However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years. Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. GEM-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.",gem ; gemcitabine @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ gem ; gemcitabine @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ methylprednisolone @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ methylprednisolone @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users. RATIONALE: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. METHOD: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy.",ecstasy ; mdma @CHEMICAL@ depression @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ifosfamide related encephalopathy: the need for a timely EEG evaluation. BACKGROUND: Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. Encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose IV ifosfamide. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients, admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. RESULTS: All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that required ICU admission and intubation. Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes. We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy.",ifosfamide @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@ ifosfamide @CHEMICAL@ non-convulsive status epilepticus ; ncse @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in hospitalised patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalised patients with cancer. METHODS: Ninety adult patients were enrolled. Patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded. Blood samples were examined the day before contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serially for 3 days thereafter. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of Cr to 25 % over baseline. Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: CIN was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (P = 0.1). CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (P = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (P = 0.017). CIN was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan (P = 0.021) and in patients with hypertension (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CIN after CT in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 %. CIN developed 4.5-times more frequently in patients with cancer who had undergone recent chemotherapy. Hypertension and the combination of bevacizumab/irinotecan may be additional risk factors for CIN development. KEY POINTS: . Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing CT. . CIN occurs more often when CT is performed <45 days after chemotherapy. .

"Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated with desvenlafaxine. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion associated with desvenlafaxine. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year old female with hyponatraemia. Her medications included desvenlafaxine, and symptoms included nausea, anxiety and confusion. The serum sodium at this time was 120 mmol/L, serum osmolality was 263 mosmol/kg, urine osmolality 410 mosmol/kg and urine sodium 63 mmol/L, consistent with a diagnosis of SIADH. Desvenlafaxine was ceased and fluid restriction implemented. After 4 days the sodium increased to 128 mmol/L and fluid restriction was relaxed. During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum sodium ranged from 134 to 137 mmol/L during treatment with mirtazapine. DISCUSSION: SIADH has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants. This case report suggests that desvenlafaxine might cause clinically significant hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for antidepressants to cause hyponatremia,and take appropriate corrective action where necessary.",desvenlafaxine @CHEMICAL@ syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ; syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone ; siadh @DISEASE@ @CID@ desvenlafaxine @CHEMICAL@ hyponatraemia ; hyponatremia @DISEASE@ @CID@ desvenlafaxine @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ desvenlafaxine @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@ desvenlafaxine @CHEMICAL@ confusion @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Oxidative stress on cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses of doxorubicin. The mechanism of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. Wistar rats (n = 66) received DOX injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the DOX acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (M0) and 1 week after each injection (M1, M2, M3, and M4) to determine the chronological effects. Animals used at M0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study. Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point. Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and DNA damage (strand breaks (SBs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased TAP. The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (R = -0.99, p = 0.011), necrosis (R = 1.00, p = 0.004), TAP (R = 0.95, p = 0.049), and DNA SBs (R = -0.95, p = 0.049). DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP (R = -0.98, p = 0.018), and necrosis (R = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only. Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of DOX. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.",doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Tacrolimus-related seizure after pediatric liver transplantation--a single-center experience. To identify the risk factors for new-onset seizures after pediatric LT and to assess their clinical implications and long-term prognosis. The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into seizures group and a non-seizures group. Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected. Seizures occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%. All exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric LT included gender, pediatric end-stage liver disease score before surgery, Child-Pugh score before surgery, serum total bilirubin after surgery, and trough TAC level. Multivariate analysis showed that trough TAC level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures. All children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure-free without anti-epileptic drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months. High trough TAC level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for TAC-related seizures.",tacrolimus ; tac @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats. The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats. There were no differences between saline- and apigenin-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial. Furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition). The saline- and apigenin-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks. In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task. At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through. These data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.",scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cholecystokinin-octapeptide restored morphine-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system. We have previously reported that CCK-8 significantly alleviated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals. Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats. Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region. Acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection. Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity: the key events in Streptozotocin (ICV) induced memory impairment in rats. In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored. In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. STZ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation. STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after STZ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in STZ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.",streptozotocin ; stz @CHEMICAL@ memory impairment ; memory impaired ; memory deficit @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin ; stz @CHEMICAL@ neuroinflammation ; neuroinflammatory @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Comparison of effects of isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between isotonic sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem application in prevention of CIN.",contrast @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure ; arf @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects in children treated on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) P9605 (standard risk) and P9201 (lesser risk) acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocols (ACCL0131): a methotrexate consequence? A report from the Children's Oncology Group. Concerns about long-term methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (IT) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic MTX administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (P9201). A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment. Significantly more P9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with P9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ. Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures).

"Pre-treatment of bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular depression using different lipid formulations of propofol. BACKGROUND: Pre-treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of bupivacaine, and the lipid content of propofol may alleviate bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of propofol in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min propofol in intralipid (Group P), propofol in medialipid (Group L), or saline (Group C) over 20 min. Thereafter, 2 mg/kg/min bupivacaine 0.5% was infused. We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption. Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole. RESULTS: The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups. The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pre-treatment with propofol in intralipid, compared with propofol in medialipid or saline, delayed the onset of bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels. Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of propofol in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity ; cardiotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@ bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ asystole @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography combined with high-sensitive cardiac troponin T in early detection and prediction of cardiotoxicity during epirubicine-based chemotherapy. AIMS: To investigate whether alterations of myocardial strain and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (cTnT) could predict future cardiac dysfunction in patients after epirubicin exposure. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with epirubicin were studied. Blood collection and echocardiography were performed at baseline, 1 day after the third cycle, and 1 day after completion of chemotherapy. Patients were studied using echocardiography during follow-up. Global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), and radial strain (GRS) were calculated using speckle tracking echocardiography. Left ventricular ejection fraction was analysed by real-time 3D echocardiography. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a reduction of the LVEF of >5% to <55% with symptoms of heart failure or an asymptomatic reduction of the LVEF of >10% to <55%. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (18.67%) developed cardiotoxicity after treatment. GLS (-18.48 + 1.72% vs. -15.96 + 1.6%), GCS (-20.93 + 2.86% vs. -19.20 + 3.21%), and GRS (39.23 + 6.44% vs. 34.98 + 6.2%) were markedly reduced and cTnT was elevated from 0.0010 + 0.0020 to 0.0073 + 0.0038 ng/mL (P all < 0.01) at the completion of chemotherapy compared with baseline values. A >15.9% decrease in GLS [sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 75%; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.815; P = 0.001] and a >0.004 ng/mL elevation in cTnT (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 64%; AUC = 0.757; P = 0.005) from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy predicted later cardiotoxicity. The decrease in GLS remained the only independent predictor of cardiotoxicity (P = 0.000).

"Prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus: which is superior: Fentanyl, midazolam, or a combination? A Retrospective comparative study. BACKGROUND: In this retrospective comparative study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl, midazolam, and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate-induced myoclonus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed based on anesthesia records. Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 ug.kg-1 (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg.kg-1 (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg.kg-1 + fentanyl 0.5 ug.kg-1 (Group FM). Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs, anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds. Myoclonic movements are evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection. The severity of pain due to etomidate injection, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85%, 40%, 70%, and 25% in Group NP, Group F, Group M, and Group FM, respectively, and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM.

Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and hypertension upon Dex administration. Male Wistar rats were treated by Dex (30  u g/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. Oral bovine LF (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study. In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the test period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail-cuff method. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weights. LF lowered (P < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (P < 0.001) Dex-induced hypertension. LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values. Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF.",dexamethasone ; dex @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone ; dex @CHEMICAL@ weight loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients. Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010. A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures. Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. The median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively. Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients. Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid. When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). Patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures. Mean (IQR [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001). Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.",tranexamic acid @CHEMICAL@ convulsive ; seizures ; seizure ; generalised and focal seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users. Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation. Previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments. We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users (n=12) and drug naive healthy controls (n=26). Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing. In addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning. Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference. Additionally, ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry, in the domains of proactive interference memory, long-term memory, encoding, working memory and complex planning. We suggest that ecstasy-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users.",ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ dysfunctional overnight memory ; impaired overnight memory ; memory impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@ ecstasy @CHEMICAL@ sleep-related impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Normoammonemic encephalopathy: solely valproate induced or multiple mechanisms? A 77-year-old woman presented with subacute onset progressive confusion, aggression, auditory hallucinations and delusions. In the preceding months, the patient had a number of admissions with transient unilateral hemiparesis with facial droop, and had been started on valproate for presumed hemiplegic migraine. Valproate was withdrawn soon after admission and her cognitive abilities have gradually improved over 3 months of follow-up. Valproate levels taken prior to withdrawal were subtherapeutic and the patient was normoammonaemic. EEG undertaken during inpatient stay showed changes consistent with encephalopathy, and low titre N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies were present in this patient.

"Cerebellar and oculomotor dysfunction induced by rapid infusion of pethidine. Pethidine is an opioid that gains its popularity for the effective pain control through acting on the opioid-receptors. However, rapid pain relief sometimes brings about unfavourable side effects that largely limit its clinical utility. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and hypotension. In patients with impaired renal and liver function, and those who need long-term pain control, pethidine may cause excitatory central nervous system (CNS) effects through its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine, resulting in irritability and seizure attack. On the contrary, though not clinically apparent, pethidine potentially causes inhibitory impacts on the CNS and impairs normal cerebellar and oculomotor function in the short term. In this case report, we highlight opioid's inhibitory side effects on the cerebellar structure that causes dysmetria, dysarthria, reduced smooth pursuit gain and decreased saccadic velocity.",pethidine @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ pethidine @CHEMICAL@ vomiting @DISEASE@ @CID@ pethidine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ pethidine @CHEMICAL@ dysmetria @DISEASE@ @CID@ pethidine @CHEMICAL@ dysarthria @DISEASE@ @CID@ norpethidine @CHEMICAL@ seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@

"A Case of Sudden Cardiac Death due to Pilsicainide-Induced Torsades de Pointes. An 84-year-old male received oral pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics, to convert his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to a sinus rhythm; the patient developed sudden cardiac death two days later. The Holter electrocardiogram, which was worn by chance, revealed torsade de pointes with gradually prolonged QT intervals. This drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and most of it is excreted from the kidney. Although the patient's renal function was not highly impaired and the dose of pilsicainide was low, the plasma concentration of pilsicainide may have been high, which can produce torsades de pointes in the octogenarian. Although the oral administration of class IC drugs, including pilsicainide, is effective to terminate atrial fibrillation, careful consideration must be taken before giving these drugs to octogenarians.",pilsicainide @CHEMICAL@ sudden cardiac death @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilsicainide @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes ; torsade de pointes @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Tolerability of lomustine in combination with cyclophosphamide in dogs with lymphoma. This retrospective study describes toxicity associated with a protocol of lomustine (CCNU) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) in dogs with lymphoma. CCNU was administered per os (PO) at a targeted dosage of 60 mg/m(2) body surface area on day 0, CTX was administered PO at a targeted dosage of 250 mg/m(2) divided over days 0 through 4, and all dogs received prophylactic antibiotics. Ninety treatments were given to the 57 dogs included in the study. Neutropenia was the principal toxic effect, and the overall frequency of grade 4 neutropenia after the first treatment of CCNU/CTX was 30% (95% confidence interval, 19-43%). The mean body weight of dogs with grade 4 neutropenia (19.7 kg + 13.4 kg) was significantly less than the mean body weight of dogs that did not develop grade 4 neutropenia (31.7 kg + 12.4 kg; P = .005). One dog (3%) developed hematologic changes suggestive of hepatotoxicity. No dogs had evidence of either renal toxicity or hemorrhagic cystitis. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were uncommon.

"Nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy: Case report and review of literature. Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported. A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. Predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region, and eventually included her distal upper extremities. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration. Nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms. Her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission, but relapsed disease 10 weeks later.

"An integrated characterization of serological, pathological, and functional events in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking. In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later.

"Intradermal glutamate and capsaicin injections: intra- and interindividual variability of provoked hyperalgesia and allodynia. Intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin are attractive to use in human experimental pain models because hyperalgesia and allodynia mimic isolated aspects of clinical pain disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these models. Twenty healthy male volunteers (mean age 24 years; range 18-38 years) received intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin in the volar forearm. Magnitudes of secondary pinprick hyperalgesia and brush-evoked allodynia were investigated using von Frey filaments (gauges 10, 15, 60 and 100 g) and brush strokes. Areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia were quantified immediately after injection and after 15, 30 and 60 min. Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed. Reproducibility across and within volunteers (inter- and intra-individual variation, respectively) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV). Secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale (VAS) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g (P < 0.001) after glutamate injection. For capsaicin, secondary pinprick hyperalgesia was detected with all von Frey gauges (P < 0.001). Glutamate evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges (ICC > 0.60) and brush strokes (ICC > 0.83). Capsaicin injection was reproducible for secondary hyperalgesia (ICC > 0.70) and allodynia (ICC > 0.71). Intra-individual variability was generally lower for the VAS response to von Frey and brush compared with areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia. In conclusion, glutamate and capsaicin yield reproducible hyperalgesic and allodynic responses, and the present model is well suited for basic research, as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena.",capsaicin @CHEMICAL@ hyperalgesia ; allodynia ; secondary hyperalgesia ; hyperalgesic ; allodynic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ocular-specific ER stress reduction rescues glaucoma in murine glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. Administration of glucocorticoids induces ocular hypertension in some patients. If untreated, these patients can develop a secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma is not fully understood, due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model. Here, we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma that exhibits glaucoma features that are observed in patients. Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0.1% dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells, and axonal degeneration, resembling glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma in human patients. Furthermore, dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork (TM). Similar to patients, withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model. Dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor CHOP, a marker for chronic ER stress, in the anterior segment tissues, and Chop deletion reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension. Furthermore, reduction of ER stress in the TM with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate prevented dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension in WT mice. Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma.",dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ glaucoma @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ ocular hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@ dexamethasone @CHEMICAL@ axonal degeneration @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of ginsenosides on opioid-induced hyperalgesia in mice. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use. OIH can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid addiction. In this study, we investigated the effects of Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH. OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days three times per day. During withdrawal (days 8 and 9), these mice were administered Re, Rg1, or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day. On the test day (day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. Re (300 mg/kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test. However, the Rg1 and Rb1 ginsenosides failed to prevent OIH in either test. Furthermore, Rg1 showed a tendency to aggravate OIH in the acetic acid-induced writhing test.

"A comparison of severe hemodynamic disturbances between dexmedetomidine and propofol for sedation in neurocritical care patients. OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine and propofol are commonly used sedatives in neurocritical care as they allow for frequent neurologic examinations. However, both agents are associated with significant hemodynamic side effects. The primary objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of severe hemodynamic effects in neurocritical care patients receiving dexmedetomidine and propofol. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING: Neurocritical care units at two academic medical centers with dedicated neurocritical care teams and board-certified neurointensivists. PATIENTS: Neurocritical care patients admitted between July 2009 and September 2012 were evaluated and then matched 1:1 based on propensity scoring of baseline characteristics. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 342 patients (105 dexmedetomidine and 237 propofol) were included in the analysis, with 190 matched (95 in each group) by propensity score. The primary outcome of this study was a composite of severe hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats/min) during sedative infusion. No difference in the primary composite outcome in both the unmatched (30% vs 30%, p = 0.94) or matched cohorts (28% vs 34%, p = 0.35) could be found. When analyzed separately, no differences could be found in the prevalence of severe hypotension or bradycardia in either the unmatched or matched cohorts.

"Hydroxytyrosol ameliorates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats with breast cancer. Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigate whether doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer. Thirty-six rats bearing breast tumors induced chemically were divided into 4 groups: control, hydroxytyrosol (0.5mg/kg, 5days/week), doxorubicin (1mg/kg/week), and doxorubicin plus hydroxytyrosol. Cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV and apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed. Hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage. These results suggest that hydroxytyrosol improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This study demonstrates that hydroxytyrosol protect rat heart damage provoked by doxorubicin decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ cardiac disturbances ; heart damage @DISEASE@ @CID@

PURPOSE: The case of an oncology patient who developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) and was treated with argatroban plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with alteplase is presented. SUMMARY: A 63-year-old Caucasian man with renal amyloidosis undergoing peripheral blood stem cell collection for an autologous stem cell transplant developed extensive bilateral upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A continuous i.v. infusion of argatroban was initiated, and the patient was managed on the general medical floor. After one week of therapy, he was transferred to the intensive care unit with cardiopulmonary compromise related to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. A percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CDT with alteplase were attempted, but the procedure was aborted due to epistaxis. The epistaxis resolved the next day, and the patient was restarted on argatroban. A second percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed six days later and resulted in partial revascularization of the SVC and central veins. Postthrombectomy continuous CDT with alteplase was commenced while argatroban was withheld, and complete patency of the SVC and central veins was achieved after three days of therapy. Alteplase was discontinued, and the patient was reinitiated on argatroban; ultimately, he was transitioned to warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. Although the patient recovered, he experienced permanent vision and hearing loss, as well as end-stage renal disease.

"Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in amphetamine-induced schizophrenia models in mice. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on animal models of schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy Swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg DHEA. The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days. Amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia. The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between March and May 2012. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests. RESULTS: In the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group. Both DHEA 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group. There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior.

"Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation. Field potential duration (FPD) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blocker effects on QT interval. However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation. The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers. hiPS-CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration. IKr and IKs blockers concentration-dependently prolonged corrected FPD (FPDc), whereas Ca(2+) channel blockers concentration-dependently shortened FPDc. Also, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner. Finally, the IKr blockers, Terfenadine and Citalopram, which are reported to cause Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization (EAD). hiPS-CMs using MEA system and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval.

"Dermal developmental toxicity of N-phenylimide herbicides in rats. BACKGROUND: S-53482 and S-23121 are N-phenylimide herbicides and produced embryolethality, teratogenicity (mainly ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs), and growth retardation in rats in conventional oral developmental toxicity studies. Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental toxicity via the dermal route, which is more relevant to occupational exposure, hence better addressing human health risks. METHODS: S-53482 was administered dermally to rats at 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg during organogenesis, and S-23121 was administered at 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg (the maximum applicable dose level). Fetuses were obtained by a Cesarean section and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations. RESULTS: Dermal exposure of rats to S-53482 at 300 mg/kg produced patterns of developmental toxicity similar to those resulting from oral exposure. Toxicity included embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation. Dermal administration of S-23121 at 800 mg/kg resulted in an increased incidence of embryonic death and ventricular septal defect, but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to S-23121. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, S-53482 and S-23121 were teratogenic when administered dermally to pregnant rats as were the compounds administered orally.

"Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin With and Without Mannitol. BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic. One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity, including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin with and without mannitol. METHODS: This single-center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage. Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single-agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012. The primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI). RESULTS: We evaluated 143 patients who received single-agent cisplatin; 97.2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy. Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.646 (95% CI = 1.008, 6.944; P = 0.048). Patients who received the 100 mg/m(2) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity: OR = 11.494 (95% CI = 4.149, 32.258; P < 0.0001) and OR = 3.219 (95% CI = 1.228, 8.439; P = 0.017), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When limited quantities of mannitol are available, it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity. Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol.",cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ acute kidney injury ; aki @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Metformin protects against seizures, learning and memory impairments and oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling in mice. Cognitive impairment, the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy, greatly diminishes the quality of life. However, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits. Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties. This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling animals. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (37 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 14 injections. Metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg/kg along with alternate-day PTZ. We found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling, ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress. Thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures.",pentylenetetrazole ; ptz @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrazole ; ptz @CHEMICAL@ learning impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrazole ; ptz @CHEMICAL@ memory impairments @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrazole ; ptz @CHEMICAL@ cognitive impairment ; cognition deficits ; cognitive deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@
"P53 inhibition exacerbates late-stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity. AIMS: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity. Children are particularly sensitive to DOX-induced heart failure. Here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose). One week after the last DOX treatment (acute stage), MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice. Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment (late stage), MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery. Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.",doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ heart failure @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats. Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.",aconitine @CHEMICAL@ arrhythmia @DISEASE@ @CID@ aconitine @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@ aconitine @CHEMICAL@ poisoning @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. Isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin. Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the heart tissues. Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg. Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg/kg, but not by 100mg/kg. Chronic pre-treatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities. This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ left ventricular dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@ isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction ; acute myocardial infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride in a Japanese patient with Huntington's disease at the terminal stage of recurrent breast cancer. We herein describe the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with tiapride (75 mg/day) and tetrabenazine (12.5 mg/day) for Huntington's disease. The patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. She also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported.

"A metoprolol-terbinafine combination induced bradycardia. To report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.",metoprolol @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ terbinafine @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Testosterone ameliorates streptozotocin-induced memory impairment in male rats. AIM: To study the effects of testosterone on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in male rats. METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were intracerebroventricularly (icv) infused with STZ (750 ug) on d 1 and d 3, and a passive avoidance task was assessed 2 weeks after the first injection of STZ. Castration surgery was performed in another group of rats, and the passive avoidance task was assessed 4 weeks after the operation. Testosterone (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), sc), the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip), the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip) or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (4 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ip) were administered for 6 d after the first injection of STZ. RESULTS: STZ administration and castration markedly decreased both STL1 (the short memory) and STL2 (the long memory) in passive avoidance tests. Testosterone replacement almost restored the STL1 and STL2 in castrated rats, and significantly prolonged the STL1 and STL2 in STZ-treated rats. Administration of flutamide, letrozole or tamoxifen significantly impaired the memory in intact rats, and significantly attenuated the testosterone replacement in improving STZ- and castration-induced memory impairment.

"Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine-induced seizures. Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart. It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases. However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures. GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice. In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice. In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice. Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice. The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus. This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 7% of hospitalized and 66% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. It increases mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines (standard operating procedures (SOP)) for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics and the occurrence of AKI. METHODS: This study was carried out as a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. Data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three ICUs at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. A total of 675 patients were included; 163 of these had therapy with vancomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; were >18 years; and treated in the ICU for >24 hours. Patients with an adherence to SOP >70% were classified into the high adherence group (HAG) and patients with an adherence of <70% into the low adherence group (LAG). AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria. Adherence to SOPs was evaluated by retrospective expert audit. Development of AKI was compared between groups with exact Chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis (two-sided P <0.05). RESULTS: LAG consisted of 75 patients (46%) versus 88 HAG patients (54%). AKI occurred significantly more often in LAG with 36% versus 21% in HAG (P = 0.035). Basic characteristics were comparable, except an increased rate of soft tissue infections in LAG. Multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.5-fold for LAG to develop AKI compared with HAG (95% confidence interval 1.195 to 5.124, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Low adherence to SOPs for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of AKI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN54598675.

"Rhabdomyolysis in a hepatitis C virus infected patient treated with telaprevir and simvastatin. A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.",telaprevir @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ simvastatin ; statin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ simvastatin ; statin ; statins @CHEMICAL@ muscle toxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Combination of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as a consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation for symptomatic multiple myeloma in Japanese patients. Consolidation therapy for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely adopted to improve treatment response following autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the safety and efficacy of combination regimen of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD) as consolidation therapy in 24 Japanese patients with newly diagnosed MM. VTD consisted of bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle, with daily oral thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/day. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were documented in four and three patients (17 and 13 %), respectively, but drug dose reduction due to cytopenia was not required in any case. Peripheral neuropathy was common (63 %), but severe grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was not observed. Very good partial response or better response (>VGPR) rates before and after consolidation therapy were 54 and 79 %, respectively. Patients had a significant probability of improving from <VGPR before consolidation therapy to >VGPR after consolidation therapy (p = 0.041).

"Conversion to sirolimus ameliorates cyclosporine-induced nephropathy in the rat: focus on serum, urine, gene, and protein renal expression biomarkers. Protocols of conversion from cyclosporin A (CsA) to sirolimus (SRL) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent CsA-induced nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear. This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of CsA-to-SRL conversion in a rat model. Four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, CsA, SRL, and conversion (CsA for 3 weeks followed by SRL for 6 weeks). Classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed. Renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson's trichrome stains. SRL-treated rats presented proteinuria and NGAL (serum and urinary) as the best markers of renal impairment. Short CsA treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and TGF-b, NF- kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes. Prolonged CsA exposure aggravated renal damage, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7, TBARs clearance, and kidney TGF-b and mTOR. Conversion to SRL prevented CsA-induced renal damage evolution (absent/mild grade lesions), while NGAL (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of CsA replacement to SRL.",sirolimus ; srl @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporine ; cyclosporin a ; csa @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy ; renal lesions ; renal impairment ; kidney lesions ; renal damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Kinin B2 receptor deletion and blockage ameliorates cisplatin-induced acute renal injury. Cisplatin treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies; however, this drug can induce acute kidney injury due its ability to negatively affect renal function, augment serum levels of creatinine and urea, increase the acute tubular necrosis score and up-regulate cytokines (e.g., IL-1b and TNF-a). The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process, as well as the regulation of cytokine expression, and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the diabetic nephropathy status. To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with cisplatin. Additionally, WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after cisplatin administration. B2 receptor-deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice, as shown by reduced weight loss, better preservation of kidney function, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis. Moreover, treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration. Thus, our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thus resulting in declined renal function. These results highlight the kinin B2 receptor antagonist treatment in amelioration of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin therapy.",cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ acute renal injury ; acute kidney injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ acute tubular necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ cisplatin @CHEMICAL@ weight loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety and efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in birdshot retinochoroidopathy. PURPOSE: To report the treatment outcomes of the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant (0.59 mg) in patients with birdshot retinochoroidopathy whose disease is refractory or intolerant to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. METHODS: A retrospective case series involving 11 birdshot retinochoroidopathy patients (11 eyes). Eleven patients (11 eyes) underwent surgery for fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59 mg). Treatment outcomes of interest were noted at baseline, before fluocinolone acetonide implant, and then at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years. Disease activity markers, including signs of ocular inflammation, evidence of retinal vasculitis, Swedish interactive threshold algorithm-short wavelength automated perimetry Humphrey visual field analysis, electroretinographic parameters, and optical coherence tomography were recorded. Data on occurrence of cataract and raised intraocular pressure were collected in all eyes. RESULTS: Intraocular inflammation was present in 54.5, 9.9, 11.1, and 0% of patients at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and beyond 3 years after receiving the implant, respectively. Active vasculitis was noted in 36.3% patients at baseline and 0% at 3 years of follow-up. More than 20% (47.61-67.2%) reduction in central retinal thickness was noted in all patients with cystoid macular edema at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant. At baseline, 54.5% patients were on immunomodulatory agents. This percentage decreased to 45.45, 44.4, and 14.28% at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postimplant, respectively. Adverse events included increased intraocular pressure (54.5%) and cataract formation (100%).

"Optimal precurarizing dose of rocuronium to decrease fasciculation and myalgia following succinylcholine administration. BACKGROUND: Succinylcholine commonly produces frequent adverse effects, including muscle fasciculation and myalgia. The current study identified the optimal dose of rocuronium to prevent succinylcholine-induced fasciculation and myalgia and evaluated the influence of rocuronium on the speed of onset produced by succinylcholine. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded study was conducted in 100 patients randomly allocated into five groups of 20 patients each. Patients were randomized to receive 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium as a precurarizing dose. Neuromuscular monitoring after each precurarizing dose was recorded from the adductor pollicis muscle using acceleromyography with train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. All patients received succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg at 2 minutes after the precurarization, and were assessed the incidence and severity of fasciculations, while myalgia was assessed at 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of visible muscle fasciculation was significantly less with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001). Those of myalgia tend to decrease according to increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium, but there was no significance (P = 0.072). The onset time of succinylcholine was significantly longer with increasing the amount of precurarizing dose of rocuronium (P < 0.001).

"Absence of PKC-alpha attenuates lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in  40% of patients. The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice. Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ; ndi @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium @CHEMICAL@ polyuria @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Rhabdomyolysis in association with simvastatin and dosage increment in clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is the most documented cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor to cause an adverse interaction with simvastatin. This particular case is of interest as rhabdomyolysis only occurred after an increase in the dose of clarithromycin. The patient developed raised cardiac biomarkers without any obvious cardiac issues, a phenomenon that has been linked to rhabdomyolysis previously. To date, there has been no reported effect of rhabdomyolysis on the structure and function of cardiac muscle. Clinicians need to be aware of prescribing concomitant medications that increase the risk of myopathy or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme. Our case suggests that troponin elevation could be associated with statin induced rhabdomyolysis, which may warrant further studies.",simvastatin ; statin @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@ clarithromycin @CHEMICAL@ rhabdomyolysis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Characterization of a novel BCHE ""silent"" allele: point mutation (p.Val204Asp) causes loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium. Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene. Here, we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a ""silent"" phenotype. Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine (BTC) and benzoylcholine, and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype. Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing. Kinetic analysis showed that the p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate. Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC, two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p.Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate. MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased, suggesting a pre-denaturation state. This fits with the reduced concentration of p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non-detectable fast moving-bands on electrophoresis gels.",suxamethonium @CHEMICAL@ apnea @DISEASE@ @CID@ suxamethonium @CHEMICAL@ butyrylcholinesterase deficiency @DISEASE@ @CID@ mivacurium @CHEMICAL@ apnea @DISEASE@ @CID@ mivacurium @CHEMICAL@ butyrylcholinesterase deficiency @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Delayed anemia after treatment with injectable artesunate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a manageable issue.

"Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by betaine attenuates isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial injury in rats. The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days. Acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days. Serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed. Oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling. Western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium. Furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. In summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ myocardial ischemia ; myocardial ischemic injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ ventricular remodeling @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Quetiapine-induced neutropenia in a bipolar patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative, similar to clozapine, which has the highest risk of causing blood dyscrasias, especially neutropenia. There are some case reports about this side effect of quetiapine, but possible risk factors are seldom discussed and identified. A case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma that developed neutropenia after treatment with quetiapine is described here. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old Taiwanese widow with bipolar disorder was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at age 60. She developed leucopenia after being treated with quetiapine. After quetiapine was discontinued, her white blood cell count returned to normal. CONCLUSIONS: Although neutropenia is not a common side effect of quetiapine, physicians should be cautious about its presentation and associated risk factors. Hepatic dysfunction may be one of the possible risk factors, and concomitant fever may be a diagnostic marker for adverse reaction to quetiapine.",quetiapine @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ quetiapine @CHEMICAL@ leucopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ quetiapine @CHEMICAL@ fever @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy (LACNP) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40-year-old woman. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before. Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area. RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) (6.2 uV) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uV). The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction. She was diagnosed with right LACNP (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings. Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree. CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.",steroid @CHEMICAL@ paresthesia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Curcumin prevents maleate-induced nephrotoxicity: relation to hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I. The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin (120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated. Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats. Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture. In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate. The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished. All the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin. It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage. The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.",maleate @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity ; renal injury ; kidney injury ; nephropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ maleate @CHEMICAL@ proteinuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ maleate @CHEMICAL@ necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Incidence of solid tumours among pesticide applicators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon in the Agricultural Health Study: an updated analysis. OBJECTIVE: Diazinon, a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with lung cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined diazinon-associated cancer risk. We used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS. METHODS: Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010(North Carolina)/2011(Iowa). Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with >10 exposed cases for both lifetime (LT) exposure days and intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure). RESULTS: We observed elevated lung cancer risks (N=283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT (RR=1.60; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.31; Ptrend=0.02) and IW days of diazinon use (RR=1.41; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.04; Ptrend=0.08). Kidney cancer (N=94) risks were non-significantly elevated (RRLT days=1.77; 95% CI 0.90 to 3.51; Ptrend=0.09; RRIW days 1.37; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.92; Ptrend=0.50), as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer (N=656). CONCLUSIONS: Our updated evaluation of diazinon provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer risk.

"Associations of Ozone and PM2.5 Concentrations With Parkinson's Disease Among Participants in the Agricultural Health Study. OBJECTIVE: This study describes associations of ozone and fine particulate matter with Parkinson's disease observed among farmers in North Carolina and Iowa. METHODS: We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self-reported, doctor-diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long-term exposure and link them to study participants' geocoded addresses. RESULTS: We observed positive associations of Parkinson's disease with ozone (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.98) and fine particulate matter (odds ratio = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.93) in North Carolina but not in Iowa. CONCLUSIONS: The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on Parkinson's disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentrations.

"Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure. UNASSIGNED: Our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) could induce intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) of offspring. Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis. However, whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms. A rat model of IUGR was established by PCE, male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized. The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein. Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio was increased. The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio. Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and podocin, was also detected by q-PCR. Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/tyrosine kinase receptor (c-Ret) signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis.",caffeine @CHEMICAL@ intrauterine growth retardation ; iugr @DISEASE@ @CID@ caffeine @CHEMICAL@ interstitial fibrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ caffeine @CHEMICAL@ dysplasia of fetal kidneys @DISEASE@ @CID@
"1,3-Butadiene, CML and the t(9:22) translocation: A reality check. UNASSIGNED: Epidemiological studies of 1,3-butadiene have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML has a well-documented association with ionizing radiation, but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been questioned. Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite CML-associated t(9:22) translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) in appropriate cells in vitro but, thus far, chemicals have not shown this capacity. We have proposed that 1,3-butadiene metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports. In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard, it is essential that a positive control for induction be available. We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control. Results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t(9:22) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro, but does so at low frequencies. Conditions that will be required for studies of 1,3-butadiene are discussed.","1,3-butadiene @CHEMICAL@ philadelphia chromosome @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the Agricultural Health Study: An update. UNASSIGNED: Metolachlor, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased liver neoplasms in female rats. Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of metolachlor have been limited. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997. We evaluated cancer incidence through 2010/2011 (NC/IA) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor. We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence. We saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific cancers. For liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant. However, trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group. A similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes. An earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update. This suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies. However, our findings for both liver cancer and follicular cell lymphoma warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of metolachlor use from other factors.",metolachlor ; metolachor @CHEMICAL@ liver neoplasms ; liver cancer @DISEASE@ @CID@ metolachlor ; metolachor @CHEMICAL@ follicular cell lymphoma @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps. BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water. Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood. There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer. OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure. DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life. Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.",inorganic arsenic ; ias ; inorganic as @CHEMICAL@ cancer @DISEASE@ @CID@

Four types of experimental arrhythmia are used--with BaCl2, with chloroform-adrenaline, with strophantine G and with aconitine. The compound P11 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally. The compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental arrhythmia used, causing greatest inhibition on the arrhythmia induced by chloroform-adrenaline (in 90 per cent) and with BaCl2 (in 84 per cent).

"Experimental progressive muscular dystrophy and its treatment with high doses anabolizing agents. We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man. Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view. Myopathy due to lack of vitamin E and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form. The authors induced myodystrophy in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in vitamin E. The pharmacological characteristics of vitamin E and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency, especially in the muscles, are illustrated. It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of myopathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre, Florence. The encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in myopathic patients by using anabolizing steroids have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent (Dianabol, CIBA) at high doses in rats rendered myopathic by a diet deficient in vitamin E. In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight (increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to ""regenerative"" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent. The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the ""regeneration"" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin E but something as yet unknown.",vitamin e @CHEMICAL@ muscular dystrophy ; myodystrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@ dianabol @CHEMICAL@ muscular dystrophy ; myodystrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Tachyphylaxis to systemic but not to airway responses during prolonged therapy with high dose inhaled salbutamol in asthmatics. High doses of inhaled salbutamol produce substantial improvements in airway response in patients with asthma, and are associated with dose-dependent systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol. Twelve asthmatic patients (FEV1, 81 +/- 4% predicted), requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy, were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol (HDS), 4,000 micrograms daily, low dose inhaled salbutamol (LDS), 800 micrograms daily, or placebo (PI) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. During the 14-day run-in and during washout periods, inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and ipratropium bromide was substituted for rescue purposes. At the end of each 14-day treatment, a dose-response curve (DRC) was performed, and airway (FEV1, FEF25-75) chronotropic (HR), tremor, and metabolic (K, Glu) responses were measured at each step (from 100 to 4,000 micrograms). Treatment had no significant effect on baseline values. There were dose-dependent increases in FEV1 and FEF25-75 (p less than 0.001), and pretreatment with HDS did not displace the DRC to the right. DRC for HR (p less than 0.001), K (p less than 0.001), and Glu (p less than 0.005) were attenuated after treatment with HDS compared with PI. There were also differences between HDS and LDS for HR (p less than 0.001) and Glu (p less than 0.05) responses.

"Increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders. The effects of oral administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (MHPG) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder. Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, nausea, palpitations, restlessness, and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects. In the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels. Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks. Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients. Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups. Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine.

"Human and canine ventricular vasoactive intestinal polypeptide: decrease with heart failure. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties. Myocardial levels of VIP were assayed before and after the development of heart failure in two canine models. In the first, cobalt cardiomyopathy was induced in eight dogs; VIP (by radioimmunoassay) decreased from 35 +/- 11 pg/mg protein (mean +/- SD) to 5 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In six dogs with doxorubicin-induced heart failure, VIP decreased from 31 +/- 7 to 11 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In addition, VIP content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients (five with rheumatic disease, nine with myxomatous degeneration) receiving mitral valve prostheses. The lowest myocardial VIP concentration was found in the hearts of patients with coronary disease (one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses) (6.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mg protein). The other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17% +/- 6% and a VIP level of 8.8 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein. The hearts without coronary artery disease (average ejection fraction of this group 62% +/- 10%) had a VIP concentration of 14.1 +/- 7.9 pg/mg protein, and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with coronary disease and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant (P less than 0.05).

"Interstrain variation in acute toxic response to caffeine among inbred mice. Acute toxic dosage-dependent behavioral effects of caffeine were compared in adult males from seven inbred mouse strains (A/J, BALB/cJ, CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, SWR/J). C57BL/6J, chosen as a ""prototypic"" mouse strain, was used to determine behavioral responses to a broad range (5-500 mg/kg) of caffeine doses. Five phenotypic characteristics--locomotor activity, righting ability, clonic seizure induction, stress-induced lethality, death without external stress--were scored at various caffeine doses in drug-naive animals under empirically optimized, rigidly constant experimental conditions. Mice (n = 12 for each point) received single IP injections of a fixed volume/g body weight of physiological saline carrier with or without caffeine in doses ranging from 125-500 mg/kg. Loss of righting ability was scored at 1, 3, 5 min post dosing and at 5 min intervals thereafter for 20 min. In the same animals the occurrence of clonic seizures was scored as to time of onset and severity for 20 min after drug administration. When these proceeded to tonic seizures, death occurred in less than 20 min. Animals surviving for 20 min were immediately stressed by a swim test in 25 degrees C water, and death-producing tonic seizures were scored for 2 min. In other animals locomotor activity was measured 15 or 60 min after caffeine administration. By any single behavioral criterion or a combination of these criteria, marked differences in response to toxic caffeine doses were observed between strains. These results indicate that behavioral toxicity testing of alkylxanthines in a single mouse strain may be misleading and suggest that toxic responses of the central nervous system to this class of compounds are genetically influenced in mammals.",caffeine @CHEMICAL@ clonic seizure ; clonic seizures ; tonic seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@

Twenty carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one carcinoma of the prostate have been reported in association with its use. The present case is the first carcinoma of the renal pelvis reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. It is the third urinary tract cancer reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment for nonmalignant disease. The association of the tumor with preexisting hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified exposure of upper urinary tract epithelium to cyclophosphamide. Patients who are candidates for long-term cyclophosphamide treatment should be routinely evaluated for obstructive uropathy.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ hematuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ carcinoma @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ carcinomas of the urinary bladder @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ascending dose tolerance study of intramuscular carbetocin administered after normal vaginal birth. OBJECTIVE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carbetocin (a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin), when administered immediately after vaginal delivery at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbetocin was given as an intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the infant in 45 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at term. Dosage groups of 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 or 200 microg carbetocin were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method (CRM). RESULTS: All dosage groups consisted of three women, except those with 100 microg (n=6) and 200 microg (n=18). Recorded were dose-limiting adverse events: hyper- or hypotension (three), severe abdominal pain (0), vomiting (0) and retained placenta (four). Serious adverse events occurred in seven women: six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml, four cases of manual placenta removal, five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion. Maximum blood loss was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels, and lowest in the 70-125 microg dose range. Four out of six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group. The majority of additional administration of oxytocics (4/5) and blood transfusion (3/5) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg. All retained placentae were found in the group of 200 microg. CONCLUSION: The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg carbetocin.",carbetocin @CHEMICAL@ hyper- or hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbetocin @CHEMICAL@ abdominal pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbetocin @CHEMICAL@ vomiting @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbetocin @CHEMICAL@ retained placenta @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbetocin @CHEMICAL@ blood loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level. Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates. None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates. CONCLUSION: No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ chest pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes during bladder irrigation: an unusual presentation--a case report. The authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with oral amiodarone therapy. Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess. Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP. It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP. The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. In the absence of amiodarone therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce TdP despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.",amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ torsade de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute renal insufficiency after high-dose melphalan in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis during stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) have a poor prognosis. Median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months. High-dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) appears to be the most promising therapy, but treatment mortality can be high. The authors have noted the development of acute renal insufficiency immediately after melphalan conditioning. This study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality. METHODS: Consecutive AL patients who underwent PBSCT were studied retrospectively. Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) after high-dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50% of baseline immediately after conditioning. Urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients studied, ARI developed in 18.8% of the patients after high-dose melphalan. Univariate analysis identified age, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, diuretic use, and urine sediment score (>3) as risk factors. Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis. Patients who had ARI after high-dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often (P = 0.007), and had a worse 1-year survival (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent. Ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment. Development of ARI adversely affected the outcome after PBSCT. Effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of PBSCT in AL patients.",melphalan @CHEMICAL@ acute renal insufficiency ; ari ; renal injury @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine users. INTRODUCTION: The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction. The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants (CN),  30 occasional cocaine (OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine (RC) users, were compared. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered. Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived. Participants were also assessed with the ""Eyes task"" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology. RESULTS: There were no group differences in psychopathology or ""eyes task"" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups. The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants. The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust. The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired. Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition, amygdala dysfunction, and etiology are discussed.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ impaired fear recognition ; deficit in fear recognition @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Corneal ulcers associated with aerosolized crack cocaine use. PURPOSE: We report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse. The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006. RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. The infections responded to antibiotic treatment. Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed. Comprehensive care may provide the patient the opportunity to discontinue their substance abuse, improve their overall health, and prevent future corneal complications.",crack cocaine @CHEMICAL@ corneal ulcers @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Levetiracetam as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with suspected idiopathic epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of oral levetiracetam administered as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with poorly controlled suspected idiopathic epilepsy. DESIGN-Open-label, noncomparative clinical trial. ANIMALS: 12 cats suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy that was poorly controlled with phenobarbital or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with phenobarbital. PROCEDURES: Cats were treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h). After a minimum of 1 week of treatment, serum levetiracetam concentrations were measured before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration, and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated. Seizure frequencies before and after initiation of levetiracetam treatment were compared, and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: Median maximum serum levetiracetam concentration was 25.5 microg/mL, median minimum serum levetiracetam concentration was 8.3 microg/mL, and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours. Median seizure frequency prior to treatment with levetiracetam (2.1 seizures/mo) was significantly higher than median seizure frequency after initiation of levetiracetam treatment (0.42 seizures/mo), and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to levetiracetam treatment (ie, reduction in seizure frequency of >or=50%). Two cats had transient lethargy and inappetence. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that levetiracetam is well tolerated in cats and may be useful as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with idiopathic epilepsy.",levetiracetam @CHEMICAL@ lethargy @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Acute renal failure after high-dose methotrexate therapy in a patient with ileostomy. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an important treatment for Burkitt lymphoma, but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed. We report a case of acute renal failure after HD-MTX therapy in a patient with ileostomy, The patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. At day 833 after the transplantation, he was diagnosed with PTLD (post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). During induction therapy, he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed. Subsequent HD-MTX therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodialysis. We supposed that intravascular hypovolemia due to substantial drainage from the ileostoma caused acute prerenal failure. After recovery of his renal function, we could safely treat the patient with HD-MTX therapy by controlling drainage from ileostoma with total parenteral nutrition.",methotrexate ; mtx @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antithrombotic drug use, cerebral microbleeds, and intracerebral hemorrhage: a systematic review of published and unpublished studies. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs. Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; (2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use. We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB. RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS/TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS/TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2.8 (odds ratio; range, 2.3-3.5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 (range, 3.4-9.7) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 (range, 3.5-17.8) in warfarin users (P difference=0.01). There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P<0.001) but none in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7; P=0.33; P difference=0.01). There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P<0.001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; P<0.001; P difference=0.25). In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.4-42.5; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Limited prospective data corroborate these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently required.",warfarin @CHEMICAL@ intracerebral hemorrhage ; ich @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Verapamil stimulation test in hyperprolactinemia: loss of prolactin response in anatomic or functional stalk effect. AIM: Verapamil stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, but with conflicting results. Macroprolactinemia was never considered in those previous studies. Here, we aimed to re-investigate the diagnostic value of verapamil in a population who were all screened for macroprolactinemia. Prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients (age: 29.9 +/- 8.1 years) with hyperprolactinemia were tested in a descriptive, matched case-control study. METHODS: Verapamil 80 mg, p.o. was administered, and then PRL levels were measured at 8th and 16th hours, by immunometric chemiluminescence. Verapamil responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels (PRL). RESULTS: Verapamil significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls (N. 8, PRL: 183%), macroprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 7%), microprolactinoma (N. 19, PRL: 21%), macroprolactinemia (N. 23, PRL: 126%), but not in pseudoprolactinoma (N. 8, PRL: 0.8%), and risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia (N. 7, PRL: 3%). ROC curve analysis revealed that unresponsiveness to verapamil defined as PRL <7%, discriminated anatomical or functional stalk effect (sensitivity: 74%, specificity: 73%, AUC: 0.855+/-0.04, P <0.001, CI: 0.768-0.942) associated with pseudoprolactinoma or risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia, respectively. CONCLUSION: Verapamil responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia. However, verapamil unresponsiveness discriminates stalk effect (i.e., anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus) from other causes of hyperprolactinemia with varying degrees of responsiveness.",risperidone @CHEMICAL@ hyperprolactinemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Central action of narcotic analgesics. Part IV. Noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rats. The effect of clonidine, naphazoline and xylometazoline on analgesia induced by morphine, codeine, fentanyl and pentazocine, and on cataleptic effect of morphine, codine and fentanyl was studied in rats. The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline (NA) were also performed. It was found that three drugs stimulating central NA receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl. Codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline. The brain concentration of NA was not changed by morphine and fentanyl, but one of the doses of codeine (45 mg/kg) slightly enhanced it. Pentazocine dose-dependently decreased the brain level of NA. The rate of NA turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl (0.2 mg/kg) following which the disappearance of NA from the brain was diminished. The results are discussed in the light of various and non-uniform data from the literature. It is suggested that in rats the brain NA plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics.",clonidine @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ naphazoline @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ xylometazoline @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ morphine @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ codeine ; codine @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ fentanyl @CHEMICAL@ cataleptic ; catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@

Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the propranolol-insulin group.

The cure rate of infections in cancer patients is adversely affected by neutropenia (less than 1,000/mm3). In particular, patients with severe neutropenia (less than 100/mm3) have shown a poor response to antibiotics. To overcome the adverse effects of neutropenia, tobramycin was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent carbenicillin. Tobramycin was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and carbenicillin was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours. There were 125 infectious episodes in 116 cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The overall cure rate was 70%. Pneumonia was the most common infection and 61% of 59 episodes were cured. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these infections were cured. The most common pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae and this, together with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounted for 74% of all gram-negative bacillary infections. Response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count, with a 62% cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe neutropenia. However, failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response. Azotemia was the major side effect recognized, and it occurred in 11% of episodes. Major azotemia (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or BUN greater than 50 mg/dl) occurred in only 2%. Azotemia was not related to duration of therapy or serum tobramycin concentration.

Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg. Chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. In 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time.

"Total intravenous anesthesia with etomidate. III. Some observations in adults. An investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of etomidate required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesia. Premedication of diazepam 10 mg and atropine 0.5 mg was given, and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of etomidate 0.1/mg/kg, given whenever the patient would open his eyes on request. A mean overall dose of etomidate 17.4 microgram/kg/min. was required to maintain sleep, but great individual variation occurred, with older patients requiring less drug. The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side-effects, particularly pain and myoclonia, which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases. It is considered unlikely that etomidate will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myoclonia after prolonged administration.

A method permitting measurement of finger tremor as a displacement-time curve is described, using a test system with simple amplitude calibration. The coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape. By means of a computer program, periods and amplitudes of tremor oscillations were calculated and classified. The event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined. The actions of fenoterol-hydrobromide, ritodrin-HCl and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method. At therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean tremor amplitude to about three times the control level. At the same time, the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10--20 ms, whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly.

In fact the concentration of free DPH was normal, the patient presented a retarded morbilliform rash during DPH treatment, the protidogram was normal, and an intradermic DPH injection had no local effect. The authors conclude that in a patient starting DPH treatment an unexpected increase in seizures, with EEG and mental changes occurring simultaneously, should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating DPH from the therapeutic regimen, even if plasma concentrations are low.",phenytoin ; dph @CHEMICAL@ encephalopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. The effect of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction was studied in male rats. Ninety-three rats were randomly divided into three groups. The exercise-isoproterenol (E-1) and exercise control (EC) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mph, 2% grade while animals of the sedentary-isoproterenol (S-I) group remained sedentary. Eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control (SC) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period. Forty-eight hours after the final exercise period, S-I and E-I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (250 mg/kg body weight). Animals of the S-I group exhibited significantly (Pp less than 0.05) greater mortality from the effects of isoproterenol than animals of the E-I group. Serum CPK activity for E-I animals was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than for animals in the S-I and EC groups twenty hours following isoproterenol injection. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two isoproterenol treated groups for severity of the induced lesions, changes in heart weight, or heart weight to body weight ratios. The results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of isoproterenol but had little on the severity of the infarction.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of D-Glucarates on basic antibiotic-induced renal damage in rats. Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides. The reduction effect of D-glucarates against nephrotoxicity of basic antibiotics was discussed.",aminoglycoside @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ kanamycin @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate: report of a case and review of the literature. A patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is discribed. The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic pH, ionic content and osmolarity. The role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. The incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. Only preservative-free methotrexate in Elliott's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration. Periodic monitoring of cerebruspinal fluid methotrexate levels may be predictive of the development of serious neurotoxicity.",methotrexate ; methothexate @CHEMICAL@ paraplegia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Centrally mediated cardiovascular effects of intracisternal application of carbachol in anesthetized rats. The pressor response to the intracisternal (i.c.) injection of carbachol (1 mug) in anesthetized rats was analyzed. This response was significantly reduced by the intravenous (i.v.) injection of guanethidine (5 mg), hexamethonium (10 mg) or phentolamine (5 mg), and conversely, potentiated by i.v. desmethylimipramine (0.3 mg), while propranolol (0.5 mg) i.v. selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i.c. carbachol (1 mug). On the other hand, the pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) was almost completely blocked by i.c. atropine (3 mug) or hexamethonium (500 mug), and significantly reduced by i.c. chlorpromazine (50 mug) but significantly potentiated by i.c. desmethylimipramine (30 mug). The pressor response to i.c. carbachol (1 mug) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord (C7-C8).

"Fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat. Dose-response relationships and effect of sex. Dose-response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro. In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride. With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats. Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride. Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers. However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions. These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid. Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride-rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.",tetracycline @CHEMICAL@ fatty liver @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures. The effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined. After determining the bupivacaine AD50 (the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1-hour progesterone HCl exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm. Each concentration of progesterone (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the AD50 for bupivacaine. Estradiol treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as progesterone. Neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by epinephrine. Chronic progesterone pretreatment (5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity in intact pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control nonprogesterone-treated rats (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- SE). The results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro.

A patient with transfusion-dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous desferrioxamine (DFX) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy. Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insufficiency. Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity.

"Pharmacology of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex after the in vivo administration of the anxioselective and anticonvulsant beta-carboline derivative abecarnil. In rodents, the effect of the beta-carboline derivative isopropyl-6- benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (abecarrnil), a new ligand for benzodiazepine receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was evaluated on the function of central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex, both in vitro and in vivo. Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, abecarnil increased [3H]GABA binding, enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and reduced the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS). These effects were similar to those induced by diazepam, whereas the partial agonist Ro 16-6028 (tert-butyl-(S)-8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H- imidazo[1,5-a]-pyrrolo-[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests. After i.p. injection to rats, abecarnil and diazepam decreased in a time-dependent and dose-related (0.25-20 mg/kg i.p.) manner [35S]TBPS binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, both drugs at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by isoniazide (350 mg/kg s.c.) as well as the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by foot-shock stress. To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects, we studied the action of abecarnil on [35S]TBPS binding, exploratory motility and on isoniazid-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice. In these animals, abecarnil produced a paralleled dose-dependent (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.) reduction of both motor behavior and cortical [35S]TBPS binding. Moreover, 0.05 mg/kg of this beta-carboline reduced markedly the increase of [35S]TBPS binding and the convulsions induced by isoniazid (200 mg/kg s.c.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",isoniazide ; isoniazid @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Pharmacodynamics of the hypotensive effect of levodopa in parkinsonian patients. Blood pressure effects of i.v. levodopa were examined in parkinsonian patients with stable and fluctuating responses to levodopa. The magnitude of the hypotensive effect of levodopa was concentration dependent and was fit to an Emax model in fluctuating responders. Stable responders demonstrated a small hypotensive response. Baseline blood pressures were higher in fluctuating patients; a higher baseline blood pressure correlated with greater hypotensive effects. Antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa temporally correlated with blood pressure changes. Phenylalanine, a large neutral amino acid (LNAA) competing with levodopa for transport across the blood-brain barrier, reduced the hypotensive and antiparkinsonian effects of levodopa. We conclude that levodopa has a central hypotensive action that parallels the motor effects in fluctuating patients.

"Heart failure: to digitalise or not? The view against. Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.",digoxin @CHEMICAL@ arrhythmias @DISEASE@ @CID@

The specific aim of this retrospective, observational study was to assess safety and efficacy of long-term (21 months/patient), open-label, gemfibrozil-lovastatin treatment in 80 patients with primary mixed hyperlipidemia (68% of whom had atherosclerotic vascular disease). Because ideal lipid targets were not reached (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol less than 130 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol greater than 35 mg/dl, or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol less than 4.5 mg/dl) with diet plus a single drug, gemfibrozil (1.2 g/day)-lovastatin (primarily 20 or 40 mg) treatment was given. Follow-up visits were scheduled with 2-drug therapy every 6 to 8 weeks, an average of 10.3 visits per patient, with 741 batteries of 6 liver function tests and 714 creatine phosphokinase levels measured. Only 1 of the 4,446 liver function tests (0.02%), a gamma glutamyl transferase, was greater than or equal to 3 times the upper normal limit.

"Chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and neurogenic tone in conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats. The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. The restimulation of this area with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response. One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats (100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group (150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups. The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (5 mg/kg i.v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups. The trimethaphan-induced hypotension was accompanied by a significant bradycardia in lesioned rats (-32 +/- 13 beats per minute) but a tachycardia in sham rats (+33 +/- 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion.

"Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the rat: immunohistochemical study of neurons, astrocytes and serum-protein extravasation. The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity. Additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR. In this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats. The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes. Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR. Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR. Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and against the glial calcium-binding protein, S-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes. Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation. Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects. At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining. By 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion. Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours. By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR. By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR. By 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area. In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR. Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus. Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR.

"Reduced cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin given in the form of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide conjugates: and experimental study in the rat. A rat model was used to evaluate the general acute toxicity and the late cardiotoxicity of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (DOX) given either as free drug or in the form of three N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer conjugates. In these HPMA copolymers, DOX was covalently bound via peptide linkages that were either non-biodegradable (Gly-Gly) or degradable by lysosomal proteinases (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly). In addition, one biodegradable conjugate containing galactosamine was used; this residue was targeted to the liver. Over the first 3 weeks after the i.v. administration of free and polymer-bound DOX, all animals showed a transient reduction in body weight. However, the maximal reduction in body weight seen in animals that received polymer-bound DOX (4 mg/kg) was significantly lower than that observed in those that received free DOX (4 mg/kg) or a mixture of the unmodified parent HPMA copolymer and free DOX (4 mg/kg; P less than 0.01). Throughout the study (20 weeks), deaths related to cardiotoxicity were observed only in animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX; in these cases, histological investigations revealed marked changes in the heart that were consistent with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Sequential measurements of cardiac output in surviving animals that received either free DOX or the mixture of HPMA copolymer and free DOX showed a reduction of approximately 30% in function beginning at the 4th week after drug administration. The heart rate in these animals was approximately 12% lower than that measured in age-matched control rats (P less than 0.05). Animals that were given the HPMA copolymer conjugates containing DOX exhibited no significant change in cardiac output throughout the study (P less than 0.05). In addition, no significant histological change was observed in the heart of animals that received DOX in the form of HPMA copolymer conjugates and were killed at the end of the study.

In order to evaluate the efficacy, time-course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin, 39 patients with chronic post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), median duration 24 months, were treated with 0.025% capsaicin cream for 8 weeks. During therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a verbal outcome scale. A follow-up investigation was performed 10-12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved. Nineteen patients (48.7%) substantially improved after the 8-week trial; 5 (12.8%) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable capsaicin-induced burning sensations (4) or mastitis (1); 15 (38.5%) reported no benefit. The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application. Of the responders 72.2% were still improved at the follow-up; only one-third of them had continued application irregularly. Treatment effect was not dependent on patient's age, duration or localization of PHN (trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character.

"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paranoia, and the ventral basal ganglia. Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.",fluoxetine @CHEMICAL@ paranoia ; paranoid @DISEASE@ @CID@ amitriptyline @CHEMICAL@ paranoia ; paranoid @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Five cases of encephalitis during treatment of loiasis with diethylcarbamazine. Five cases of encephalitis following treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were observed in Congolese patients with Loa loa filariasis. Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae. The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i.e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti-allergic treatment. This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions. It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load. The relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident. The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature.",diethylcarbamazine ; dec @CHEMICAL@ encephalitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Delirium in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of misoprostol. Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache. Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported. We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy. The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy.",misoprostol @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver. The pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo. Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glutathione. There was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury. An increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes. These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue GSSG may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.",oxidized glutathione ; gssg @CHEMICAL@ reperfusion injury @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Diphenhydramine prevents the haemodynamic changes of cimetidine in ICU patients. Cimetidine, a histamine 2 (H2) antagonist, produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients. This may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agonist. We, therefore, investigated the effects of the histamine 1(H1) receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine, on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ICU patients. Each patient was studied on two separate days. In a random fashion, they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of diphenhydramine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv. In the non-pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 107.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 86.7 +/- 11.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01) two minutes after cimetidine. Also, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased during the eight-minute observation period (P less than 0.01). In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen. We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine, since the vasodilating activity of cimetidine is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.",cimetidine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs. The effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and pinacidil (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin (0.03-10 micrograms/kg). Nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD. Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in CxAD.",cromakalim @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ cromakalim @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@ pinacidil @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ pinacidil @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Etiology of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients on calcium carbonate therapy. Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients (36%) became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder. In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia, indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age, sex, length of time on dialysis, and etiology of renal disease. In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/L (10.7 to 15.0 mg/dL), patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch, compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch (2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/L [9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dL], P = 0.006). In contrast, eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean calcium values over the same time period (2.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.3 +/- 0.05 mmol/L [9.2 +/- 0.2 to 9.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dL]). CaCO3 dosage, calculated dietary calcium intake, and circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites were similar in both groups.

"The long-term safety of danazol in women with hereditary angioedema. Although the short-term safety (less than or equal to 6 months) of danazol has been established in a variety of settings, no information exists as to its long-term safety. We therefore investigated the long-term safety of danazol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with danazol for a continuous period of 6 months or longer. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months. Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions. Menstrual abnormalities (79%), weight gain (60%), muscle cramps/myalgias (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions. The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients. No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug.

"Patient tolerance study of topical chlorhexidine diphosphanilate: a new topical agent for burns. Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients. Chlorhexidine phosphanilate (CHP), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application. This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy. Twenty-nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period. One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine (AgSD) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds. The other site was always treated with AgSD cream. There was a direct relationship between CHP concentration and patients' ratings of pain on an analogue scale. The 0.25 per cent CHP cream was closest to AgSD in pain tolerance; however, none of the treatments differed statistically from AgSD or from each other. In addition, ease of application of CHP creams was less satisfactory than that of AgSD. It was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent CHP may prove acceptable for wound care, but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use.",chlorhexidine diphosphanilate ; chlorhexidine phosphanilate ; chp @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Dose-dependent neurotoxicity of high-dose busulfan in children: a clinical and pharmacological study. Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans, but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children. We report here a retrospective study of 123 children (median age, 6.5 years) receiving high-dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors, brain tumors excluded. Busulfan was given p.o., every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days. Two total doses were consecutively used: 16 mg/kg, then 600 mg/m2. The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients (16 to 28 mg/kg). Ninety-six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis; 7 (7.5%) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing. When the total busulfan dose was taken into account, there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg/kg (1 of 57, 1.7%) and patients under 600 mg/m2 (6 of 39, 15.4%) (P less than 0.02). Twenty-seven patients were given a 600-mg/m2 busulfan total dose with continuous i.v. infusion of clonazepam; none had any neurological symptoms. Busulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg/m2 busulfan with clonazepam:busulfan cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio was 1.39. This was significantly different (P less than 0.02) from the cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16-mg/kg total dose of busulfan. This study shows that busulfan neurotoxicity is dose-dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clonazepam. A busulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area, resulting in higher doses in young children, was followed by increased neurotoxicity, close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adults. Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults, this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg/kg total dose, with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects. The busulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies.",busulfan @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Histamine antagonists and d-tubocurarine-induced hypotension in cardiac surgical patients. Hemodynamic effects and histamine release by bolus injection of 0.35 mg/kg of d-tubocurarine were studied in 24 patients.

Histamine release occurred in most patients, the highest level 2 minutes after d-tubocurarine dosing. Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma histamine change and systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.58; P less than 0.05) not present in group 4. Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance. These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with d-tubocurarine dosing are only partially explained by histamine release. Thus prior dosing with H1- and H2-antagonists provides only partial protection.",d-tubocurarine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Convulsant effect of lindane and regional brain concentration of GABA and dopamine. Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine insecticide with known neurotoxic effects. Its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that lindane acts as a non-competitive antagonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor. We studied the effect of lindane (150 mg/kg) on the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems by measuring the concentration of GABA, dopamine and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of seizures. All animals suffered tonic convulsions at 18.3 +/- 1.4 min after lindane administration. The concentration of GABA was only slightly but significantly decreased in the colliculi without modifications in the other areas.

"Anticonvulsant actions of MK-801 on the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats. MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone. Three major results are reported. First, pretreatment with MK-801 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium-pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models. Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK-801 in the lithium-pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity. This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK-801 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor. Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures. Administration of MK-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i.e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate. These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium-pilocarpine model. This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@

"The effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intoxication. The effectiveness of haloperidol pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of amphetamine and cocaine was studied in rats. In this model, toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of amphetamine 75 mg/kg (100% death rate) or cocaine 70 mg/kg (82% death rate). Haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine-induced seizures, but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested. Haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine-induced seizures at the two highest doses, but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose. These data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high-dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures.

Thus, ""stress"" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect.

"Effect of alkylxanthines on gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in the rat. Adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure (ARF). In the present study, the effects of three alkylxanthines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline, were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin (200 mg kg-1). Renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma urea and creatinine), functional (urine analysis and [3H]inulin and [14C]p-aminohippuric acid clearances) and morphological (degree of necrosis) indices. The various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function. However, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (polyethylene glycol and NaOH). The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkylxanthines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in gentamicin-induced ARF.",gentamicin @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure ; arf @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Adverse ocular reactions possibly associated with isotretinoin. A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received isotretinoin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic acne.

"Subacute effects of propranolol and B 24/76 on isoproterenol-induced rat heart hypertrophy in correlation with blood pressure. We compared the potential beta-receptor blocker, B 24/76 i.e. 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-prop an-2-ol, which is characterized by beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulating properties with propranolol. The studies were performed using an experimental model of isoproterenol-induced heart hypertrophy in rats. A correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of heart hypertrophy with the two beta-receptor blockers. Both beta-blockers influenced the development of hypertrophy to a different, but not reproducible extent. It was possible to suppress the increased ornithine decarboxylase activity with both beta-blockers in hypertrophied hearts, but there was no effect on the heart mass. Neither propranolol nor B 24/76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the hypertrophied rat heart. Thus, the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta-receptor blockers propranolol and B 24/76 have the potency to prevent isoproterenol from producing heart hypertrophy.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ heart hypertrophy ; hypertrophied hearts @DISEASE@ @CID@

The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline.

Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ, memory, naming, and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include: a direct central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect of valproic acid; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through valproic acid-induced hyperammonemia.",valproic acid @CHEMICAL@ dementia @DISEASE@ @CID@ valproic acid @CHEMICAL@ hyperammonemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reversal of scopolamine-induced amnesia of passive avoidance by pre- and post-training naloxone. In a series of five experiments, the modulating role of naloxone on a scopolamine-induced retention deficit in a passive avoidance paradigm was investigated in mice. Scopolamine, but not methyl scopolamine (1 and 3 mg/kg), induced an amnesia as measured by latency and duration parameters. Naloxone (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) injected prior to training attenuated the retention deficit with a peak of activity at 3 mg/kg. The effect of naloxone could be antagonized with morphine (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), demonstrating the opioid specificity of the naloxone effect. Post-training administration of naloxone (3 mg/kg) as a single or as a split dose also attenuated the scopolamine-induced amnesia. Control experiments indicated that neither an increase in pain sensitivity (pre-training naloxone) nor an induced aversive state (post-training naloxone) appear to be responsible for the influence of naloxone on the scopolamine-induced retention deficit. These results extend previous findings implicating a cholinergic-opioid interaction in memory processes.

"Electron microscopic investigations of the cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder of the rat and their prevention by mesna. Fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium, severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle necroses. The initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane. This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine. Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane. The morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules. These changes can be effectively prevented by mesna. The only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells.",cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ lesions of the urinary bladder @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children: inhibition by alfentanil. Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.",suxamethonium @CHEMICAL@ muscle fasciculations @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute insulin treatment normalizes the resistance to the cardiotoxic effect of isoproterenol in streptozotocin diabetic rats. A morphometric study of isoproterenol induced myocardial fibrosis. The acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of streptozotocin diabetes against the cardiotoxic effect of high doses of isoproterenol (ISO) was investigated in rats. Thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin, ISO was given subcutaneously and when ISO induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later, a highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, 2 p = 0.006) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appeared. The myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rats. The norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained unchanged. An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this catecholamine resistance. The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the ISO resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rats. The phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.",isoproterenol ; iso @CHEMICAL@ fibrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin @CHEMICAL@ diabetic ; diabetes @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Differential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats. The muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, on seizures produced by pilocarpine. Pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate, ED50 103 mg/kg (60-174), and phenylbutazone, 59 mg/kg (50-70) converted the non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg, to a convulsant one. Indomethacin, 1-10 mg/kg, and ibuprofen, 10-100 mg/kg, failed to modulate seizures produced by pilocarpine. Mefenamic acid, 26 (22-30) mg/kg, prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure-related brain damage induced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg.

When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation, this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant cancers including malignant glioma. In six of eight patients (75%) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma, sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred. This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose etoposide therapy. Significant clinical manifestations have included confusion, papilledema, somnolence, exacerbation of motor deficits, and sharp increase in seizure activity. These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy. In all patients, computerized tomographic (CT) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans.

"Differential effects of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: therapeutic implications. Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities. Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity. In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue. As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function. Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy. Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of hypertension. The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina. Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache, dementia, and stroke. In general, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated, with headache, facial flushing, palpitations, edema, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness being the more common adverse effects.",calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@ calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ flushing @DISEASE@ @CID@ calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ edema @DISEASE@ @CID@ calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ nausea @DISEASE@ @CID@ calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ anorexia @DISEASE@ @CID@ calcium channel blockers ; calcium channel blocking agents @CHEMICAL@ dizziness @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The enhancement of aminonucleoside nephrosis by the co-administration of protamine. An experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin-aminonucleoside (AMNS) and protamine sulfate (PS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous PS (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days. The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals. The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. They developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure. The time-course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference (P less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, AMNS alone, PS alone or saline injected. Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive FSGS. The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm. Therefore, it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the toxicity of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats resulting in the end-stage renal disease.",aminonucleoside ; puromycin-aminonucleoside ; amns @CHEMICAL@ focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ; fsgs @DISEASE@ @CID@ aminonucleoside ; puromycin-aminonucleoside ; amns @CHEMICAL@ nephrotic syndrome @DISEASE@ @CID@ aminonucleoside ; puromycin-aminonucleoside ; amns @CHEMICAL@ end-stage renal disease @DISEASE@ @CID@
Theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rats. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregnancy. Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively. Theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum (total) and CSF were similar but serum (free) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats. Theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats. Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former.

"Participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. The effects of microinjection of clonidine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intramedullary administration of clonidine, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. The clonidine-induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy. On the other hand, the clonidine-induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection. Furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal 5-HT nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats. The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia.

"Hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imipramine. Hypertension is a well-known finding in some patients with neuroblastoma. However, it has not previously been described in association with the use of Imipramine. We report the occurrence of severe hypertension (blood pressure 190/160) in a 4-year-old girl with neuroblastoma who was given Imipramine to control a behavior disorder. It was determined later that this patient's tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive episode. Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the Imipramine (when she was in florid relapse), we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hypertension. The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by Imipramine. From this experience, we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma.",imipramine @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; hypertensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Rechallenge of patients who developed oral candidiasis or hoarseness with beclomethasone dipropionate.

"Cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity: an analysis of dosing as a risk factor. Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide (CYA) which is usually calculated based on the patient's weight. At these high doses of CYA, serious cardiotoxicity may occur, but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described. Since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area, we retrospectively calculated the dose of CYA in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of CYA cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area. Eighty patients who were to receive CYA 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. Fourteen of 84 (17%) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with CYA cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of CYA. Six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart failure. The dose of CYA per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily CYA dose: Group 1, CYA less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d; Group 2, CYA greater than 1.55 g/m2/d. Cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to CYA occurred in 1/32 (3%) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 (25%) patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.025). Congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 (12%) of patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.25). There was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups (P greater than 0.5). We conclude that the CYA cardiotoxicity correlates with CYA dosage as calculated by body surface area, and that patients with aplastic anemia and immunodeficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a CYA dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose CYA dosage is calculated based on weight.

"Studies of risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The epidemiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood. Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients, but rarely, if ever, cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80%. Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy, plasma aminoglycoside levels, liver disease, advanced age, high initial estimated creatinine clearance and, possibly, female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity. Other causes of acute renal failure, such as shock, appear to have an additive effect. Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk.

"Flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG): evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits. These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of MSG produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility, since previous investigations were inconclusive. A flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g). MSG treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold. A naloxone (5 mg/kg) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of MSG-treated mice. Flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure; however, the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear.

"Susceptibility to seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats after microinjection of isoniazid or gamma-vinyl-GABA into the substantia nigra. Pilocarpine, given intraperitoneally to rats, reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the forebrain. In the present study, the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats, were investigated. In animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid, 150 micrograms, an inhibitor of activity of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), bilaterally, non-convulsant doses of pilocarpine, 100 and 200 mg/kg, resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine-induced convulsions. Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure-related damage to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra and neocortex, which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg/kg. Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg. Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, gamma-vinyl-GABA (D,L-4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid), 5 micrograms, into the SNR, bilaterally, suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage. Microinjections of gamma-vinyl-GABA, 5 micrograms, into the dorsal striatum, bilaterally, failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. The results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; convulsive ; convulsions ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@

Patients were divided into three groups; 19 patients without myocardial infarction (non-MI group), 14 with anterior infarction (ANT-MI) and eight with inferior infarction (INF-MI). Eighty-seven unipolar electrocardiograms (ECGs) distributed over the entire thoracic surface were simultaneously recorded. After dipyridamole, ischemic ST-segment depression (0.05 mV or more) was observed in 84% of the non-MI group, 29% of the ANT-MI group, 63% of the INF-MI group and 61% of the total population. Exercise-induced ST depression was observed in 84% of the non-MI group, 43% of the ANT-MI group, 38% of the INF-MI group and 61% of the total. For individual patients, there were no obvious differences between the body surface distribution of ST depression in both tests. The increase in pressure rate product after dipyridamole was significantly less than that during the treadmill exercise. The data suggest that the dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia is caused by the inhomogenous distribution of myocardial blood flow. We conclude that the dipyridamole ECG test is as useful as the exercise ECG test for the assessment of coronary artery disease.",dipyridamole @CHEMICAL@ myocardial ischemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Bradycardia after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. In 5 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) therapy (1 g daily for 2 or 3 consecutive days), a decline in pulse rate was observed, most pronounced on day 4. In one of the 5 patients the bradycardia was associated with complaints of substernal pressure. Reversal to normal heart rate was found on day 7. Electrocardiographic registrations showed sinus bradycardia in all cases. No significant changes in plasma concentrations of electrolytes were found. Careful observation of patients receiving high-dose MP is recommended.

"Two cases of downbeat nystagmus and oscillopsia associated with carbamazepine. Downbeat nystagmus is often associated with structural lesions at the craniocervical junction, but has occasionally been reported as a manifestation of metabolic imbalance or drug intoxication. We recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible downbeat nystagmus related to carbamazepine therapy. The nystagmus of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum carbamazepine levels. Neuroradiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormality. In patients with downbeat nystagmus who are taking anticonvulsant medications, consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken.",carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ oscillopsia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Improvement by denopamine (TA-064) of pentobarbital-induced cardiac failure in the dog heart-lung preparation. The efficacy of denopamine, an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations. Cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital (118 +/- 28 mg; mean value +/- SD) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) had been reduced by about 35% and 26% of the respective controls were improved by denopamine (10-300 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. With 100 micrograms denopamine, almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained, associated with a slight increase in heart rate. No arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine. The results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure.",pentobarbital @CHEMICAL@ cardiac failure @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Salicylate nephropathy in the Gunn rat: potential role of prostaglandins. We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat. The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals. Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. The other kidney was examined histologically. A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jJ). These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.",aspirin @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy ; renal damage ; deterioration of renal function @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prophylactic lidocaine in the early phase of suspected myocardial infarction. Four hundred two patients with suspected myocardial infarction seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double-blind randomized trial of lidocaine vs placebo. During the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia among the 204 patients with acute myocardial infarction was low, 1.5%. Lidocaine, given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously, did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia, although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine (p less than 0.05). The average plasma lidocaine level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a myocardial infarction was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute infarction. The mean plasma lidocaine level of patients on beta-blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking agents. During the 1-hour study period, the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the lidocaine group, hypotension occurred in 11 patients, nine of whom had received lidocaine, and four patients died from asystole, three of whom had had lidocaine. We cannot advocate the administration of lidocaine prophylactically in the early hours of suspected myocardial infarction.",lidocaine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. Large doses of the cholinomimetic, pilocarpine, could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked. Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker, haloperidol. A muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, disrupted haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine-synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium, prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the catalepsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems. Alternatively, activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catalepsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion. Barium-supplemented Long-Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium (100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water) treatment. Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system. The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital. Under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats. The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response. Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed. The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen. Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity. In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium-exposed rats. Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure. These experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.",barium chloride @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@ barium chloride @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathic disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine-induced hypertension. Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) overdose can cause severe hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death. We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA-induced hypertension. Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA. PPA, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic). Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min). Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects. Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by propranolol 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5). We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output. That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine. This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine.",phenylpropanolamine ; ppa @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis. The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to ""mesangial overloading.""",aminonucleoside ; puromycin aminonucleoside ; pan @CHEMICAL@ proteinuric @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors. A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.",nicotine @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The role of p-aminophenol in acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on acetaminophen and p-aminophenol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats. Acetaminophen (APAP) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recently, p-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that PAP formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.",p-aminophenol ; pap @CHEMICAL@ tubular necrosis ; renal tubular necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ acetaminophen ; apap @CHEMICAL@ tubular necrosis ; renal tubular necrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
Morphine-induced seizures in newborn infants. Two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post-operative analgesia. They received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no seizures. Plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml). Other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months. It is suggested that post-operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.,morphine ; morphine sulfate @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of vincristine sulfate on Pseudomonas infections in monkeys. In rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. Leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died.

"Central excitatory actions of flurazepam. Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.",flurazepam ; fzp @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrazol ; ptz @CHEMICAL@ convulsions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Evidence for cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man. We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Hormones and risk of breast cancer. This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. The mean treatment period was 18 months. During the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.",conjugated estrogens ; premarin @CHEMICAL@ mastodynia @DISEASE@ @CID@ medroxyprogesterone acetate @CHEMICAL@ mastodynia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Early infections in kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients on cyclosporine. Eighty-one renal, seventeen heart, and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for infection. Seventeen renal patients received azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine-and-prednisone-treated renal transplant patients. All others received cyclosporine and prednisone. The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections (P less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (P less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients. There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients. Pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine-treated renal patients than in Aza-treated patients (P less than 0.05).

"Structure-activity and dose-effect relationships of the antagonism of picrotoxin-induced seizures by cholecystokinin, fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (CCK-8-SE) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice. Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule. The analogues CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK-8-NS. The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE.

"Vasopressin as a possible contributor to hypertension. The role of vasopressin as a pressor agent to the hypertensive process was examined. Vasopressin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hypertension, since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with lithium-treated diabetes insipidus after DOCA-salt treatment. Administration of DDAVP which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of AVP. Furthermore, the pressor action of vasopressin appears to be important in the development of this model of hypertension, since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of hypertension. Increased secretion of vasopressin from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hypertension. An unproportional release of vasopressin compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the brain. However, the role of vasopressin remains to be determined in human essential hypertension.",doca @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; hypertensive @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium @CHEMICAL@ diabetes insipidus @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol. Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm.

Animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). Tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. Complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. In the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. The same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. In conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat. Albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ albuminuria @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ ascites @DISEASE@ @CID@ doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ hydrothorax @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension associated with timolol and pilocarpine eye drops. A 69-yr-old man, who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops, developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaesthesia. Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine. Timolol (but not pilocarpine) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of timolol (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypotension.

"Succinylcholine apnoea: attempted reversal with anticholinesterases. Anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succinylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase. Edrophonium 10 mg, given 74 min after succinylcholine, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained. Repeated doses of edrophonium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block. Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after succinylcholine administration. It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succinylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block.",succinylcholine @CHEMICAL@ apnoea @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effect of doxorubicin on [omega-I-131]heptadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dogs. The effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with [omega-I-131]heptadecanoic acid (I-131 HA), and on global left-ventricular function determined echocardiographically, were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs. Total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin-treated dogs. A significant and then progressive fall in global LV function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg/kg. A significant increase in the myocardial t1/2 of the I-131 HA was observed only at a higher cumulative dose, 10 mg/kg. No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin. Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with I-131 HA are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat. Male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 (50 mg/kg) 7 days prior to injection of D-amphetamine (10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p.). The hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine (10 mumol/kg) was significantly reduced by DSP4 pretreatment. However, the increased rearings and the amphetamine-induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with DSP4. The reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by DSP4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline-uptake blocking agent, desipramine, which prevents the neurotoxic action of DSP4. The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat.",d-amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Studies on the bradycardia induced by bepridil. Bepridil, a novel active compound for prophylactic treatment of anginal attacks, induced persistent bradycardia and a non-specific anti-tachycardial effect, the mechanisms of which were investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro perfusion of bepridil in the life-support medium for isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit heart, caused a reduction in action potential (AP) spike frequency (recorded by KCl microelectrodes) starting at doses of 5 X 10(-6) M. This effect was dose-dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10(-5) M, whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in. Bepridil at a dose of 5 X 10(-6) M, induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude (falling from 71 +/- 8 mV to 47 +/- 6 mV), maximum systolic depolarization velocity (phase 0) which fell from 1.85 +/- 0.35 V/s to 0.84 +/- 0.28 V/s, together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity (phase 4) which fell from 38 +/- 3 mV/s to 24 +/- 5 mV/s. In vivo injection of bepridil at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.v.) into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply, together with a bilateral medullo-adrenalectomy, caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 98.7 +/- 4.2 beats/min to 76 +/- 5.3 beats/min sustained for more than 45 min. It is concluded that bepridil reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus node. This effect, which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope, together with a longer AP duration, may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents (already demonstrated elsewhere), but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward potassium current (Ip).",bepridil @CHEMICAL@ bradycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped.

"Medial changes in arterial spasm induced by L-norepinephrine. In normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by L-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function. The experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spasm.

"A large population-based follow-up study of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and cephalexin for uncommon serious drug toxicity. We conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), 266,951 prescribed trimethoprim alone, and 196,397 prescribed cephalexin, to estimate the risk of serious liver, blood, skin, and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs. The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom, together with a review of clinical records. The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP-SMZ (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone (3.8/100,000). The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000). Only five patients experienced blood disorders, one of whom was exposed to TMP-SMZ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, four were exposed to TMP-SMZ. The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin. Finally, only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred, none likely to be caused by a study drug.

"The dose-dependent effect of misoprostol on indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhosis. Misoprostol (200 micrograms) has been shown to acutely counteract the indomethacin-induced renal dysfunction in well compensated cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of misoprostol was dose-dependent. Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular sodium and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of indomethacin and various doses of misoprostol. The 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of indomethacin, whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and sodium retention. These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter. These results suggest that the renal protective effects of misoprostol is dose-dependent. However, until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of misoprostol to prevent the adverse effects of indomethacin on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing, it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with cirrhosis.",indomethacin @CHEMICAL@ renal dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute cardiomyopathy. We describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute circulatory failure from myocardial dysfunction. Three patients had acute viral myocarditis, one had a carbamazepine-induced acute eosinophilic myocarditis, and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute cardiogenic shock. All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring. An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias. All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output. These patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes. In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR. We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute myocardial dysfunction may not have long-term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.",carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ myocarditis @DISEASE@ @CID@ carbamazepine @CHEMICAL@ eosinophilic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Efficacy and safety of granisetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist, in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high-dose cisplatin. PURPOSE: To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron (Kytril; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) when administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (P = .0015) and vomiting (P = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (P = .040). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%).

"Adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil. OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of a possible adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil resulting in atrioventricular (AV) block in both patients and severe hypotension in one patient. CASE SUMMARIES: A 54-year-old woman with hyperaldosteronism was treated with verapamil 480 mg/d and spironolactone 100 mg/d. After the addition of a minimal dose of clonidine (0.15 mg bid), she developed complete AV block and severe hypotension, which resolved upon cessation of all medications. A 65-year-old woman was treated with extended-release verapamil 240 mg/d. After the addition of clonidine 0.15 mg bid she developed complete AV block, which resolved after all therapy was stopped. DISCUSSION: An adverse interaction between clonidine and verapamil has not been reported previously. We describe two such cases and discuss the various mechanisms that might cause such an interaction. Clinicians should be acquainted with this possibly fatal interaction between two commonly used antihypertensive drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is recommended in combining clonidine and verapamil therapy, even in patients who do not have sinus or AV node dysfunction. The two drugs may act synergistically on both the AV node and the peripheral circulation.",clonidine @CHEMICAL@ atrioventricular (av) block ; av block @DISEASE@ @CID@ clonidine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ verapamil @CHEMICAL@ atrioventricular (av) block ; av block @DISEASE@ @CID@ verapamil @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacological studies on a new dihydrothienopyridine calcium antagonist, S-312-d. 5th communication: anticonvulsant effects in mice. S-312, S-312-d, but not S-312-l, L-type calcium channel antagonists, showed anticonvulsant effects on the audiogenic tonic convulsions in DBA/2 mice; and their ED50 values were 18.4 (12.8-27.1) mg/kg, p.o. and 15.0 (10.2-23.7) mg/kg, p.o., respectively, while that of flunarizine was 34.0 (26.0-44.8) mg/kg, p.o. Although moderate anticonvulsant effects of S-312-d in higher doses were observed against the clonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (85 mg/kg, s.c.) or bemegride (40 mg/kg, s.c.), no effects were observed in convulsions induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, picrotoxin, or electroshock in Slc:ddY mice.

"Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4.

"Mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin-mediated nephropathy in rats. Studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin (GM)-mediated nephropathy. Administration of GM at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) and inulin clearance (CIn) as well as marked tubular damage. A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in GM-mediated nephropathy. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) or dimethylthiourea (DMTU) significantly lessened the GM-induced decrement in CIn. The SOD-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content. SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage. In contrast, DMTU significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances. Neither SOD nor DMTU affected the renal cortical GM content in GM-treated rats. These results suggest that 1) both SOD and DMTU have protective effects on GM-mediated nephropathy, 2) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for SOD and DMTU, and 3) superoxide anions play a critical role in GM-induced renal vasoconstriction.",gentamicin ; gm @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy ; tubular damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Assessment of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice. The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. Isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb/FeJ mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. No DNA synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ cardiac hypertrophy ; hypertrophic hearts @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Central cardiovascular effects of AVP and ANP in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin (AVP) and of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on control of arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Three series of experiments were performed on 30 WKY and 30 SHR, chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle (LV) and arterial and venous catheters. MAP and HR were monitored before and after i.v. injections of either vehicle or 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP and 25, 125 and 500 ng of ANP. Sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex (CCB), expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and HR period (HRp) during phenylephrine (Phe)-induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside (SN)-induced hypotension. CCB was measured before and after administration of either vehicle, AVP, ANP, or both peptides together. Increases of MAP occurred after LV administration of 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP in WKY and of 10 and 50 ng in SHR. ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains as compared to vehicle, but it abolished AVP-induced MAP increase in WKY and SHR. CCB was reduced in WKY and SHR after LV administration of AVP during SN-induced hypotension. In SHR but not in WKY administration of ANP, AVP and ANP + AVP decreased CCB during Phe-induced MAP elevation. The results indicate that centrally applied AVP and ANP exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in WKY and SHR and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system.",avp ; arginine vasopressin @CHEMICAL@ hypertensive ; hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@ phenylephrine ; phe @CHEMICAL@ hypertensive ; hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@ sodium nitroprusside ; sn @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Pediatric heart transplantation without chronic maintenance steroids. From 1986 to February 1993, 40 children aged 2 months to 18 years (average age 10.4 +/- 5.8 years) underwent heart transplantation. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (52%), congenital heart disease (35%) with and without prior repair (71% and 29%, respectively), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5%), valvular heart disease (3%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (5%). Patients were managed with cyclosporine and azathioprine. No prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used. Steroids were given to 39% of patients for refractory rejection, but weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%). Five patients (14%) received maintenance steroids. Four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later. There have been no deaths related to rejection or infection. Average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months (range 1 to 65 months). Cumulative survival is 88% at 5 years. In patients less than 7 years of age, rejection was monitored noninvasively. In the first postoperative month, 89% of patients were treated for rejection. Freedom from serious infections was 83% at 1 month and 65% at 1 year. Cytomegalovirus infections were treated successfully with ganciclovir in 11 patients. No impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population. Twenty-one patients (60%) have undergone annual catheterizations and no sign of graft atherosclerosis has been observed.

"Pulmonary edema and shock after high-dose aracytine-C for lymphoma; possible role of TNF-alpha and PAF. Four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose Ara-C for lymphomas in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion. It was characterized by the onset of fever, diarrhea, shock, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, weight gain and leukocytosis. Thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of infection. Sequential biological assays of IL-1, IL-2, TNF and PAF were performed during Ara-C infusion to ten patients, including the four who developed the syndrome. TNF and PAF activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases, but not in the six controls. As TNF and PAF are thought to be involved in the development of septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesize that high-dose Ara-C may be associated with cytokine release.",aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary edema @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ shock @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ fever @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ diarrhea @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ metabolic acidosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ weight gain @DISEASE@ @CID@ aracytine-c ; ara-c @CHEMICAL@ leukocytosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Protective effect of clentiazem against epinephrine-induced cardiac injury in rats. We investigated the effects of clentiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine calcium antagonist, on epinephrine-induced cardiomyopathy in rats. With 2-week chronic epinephrine infusion, 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days, and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed. In epinephrine-treated rats, left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced, but responses to calcium were normal or enhanced compared to controls. Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls. Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine-induced death (P < .05), and attenuated the ventricular ischemic lesions and fibrosis, in a dose-dependent manner. Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone, but combined with epinephrine, clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol. On the other hand clentiazem did not prevent epinephrine-induced down-regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Interestingly, clentiazem, infused alone, resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle. Clentiazem also did not prevent the enhanced responses to calcium seen in the epinephrine-treated animals, although the high dose of clentiazem partially attenuated the maximal response to calcium compared to epinephrine-treated animals. In conclusion, clentiazem attenuated epinephrine-induced cardiac injury, possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway.",epinephrine @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity monitored by ECG in freely moving mice. A new model to test potential protectors. In laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed. Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry. With this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of ICRF-187 as a protective agent. The ST interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 (7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation). The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study. After sacrifice the hearts of doxorubicin-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were hypertrophic. As this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of ICRF-187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity (6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation). On this schedule, the animals' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ICRF-187 (50 mg/kg given i.p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection. These data were confirmed by histology. The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time. These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by ICRF-187.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity is not enhanced by subtoxic bupivacaine in dogs. Since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dysrhythmias, circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. We therefore examined whether bupivacaine alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of epinephrine in conscious, healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with myocardial infarction. Forty-one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. Seventeen animals responded with ventricular tachycardia (VT) within 3 min. After 3 h, these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg/kg bupivacaine or saline over 5 min, followed by 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. In the bupivacaine groups, epinephrine caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without bupivacaine. VT appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time, and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies. Epinephrine shortened QT less after bupivacaine than in control animals. One day after experimental myocardial infarction, six additional halothane-anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine until VT appeared. After 45 min, 1 mg/kg bupivacaine was injected over 5 min, again followed by 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 epinephrine. In these dogs, the prodysrhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bupivacaine. Bupivacaine antagonizes epinephrine dysrhythmogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to VT and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postinfarct dysrhythmias. There is no evidence that systemic subtoxic bupivacaine administration enhances the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent epinephrine.",epinephrine @CHEMICAL@ ventricular tachycardia ; vt @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Milk-alkali syndrome induced by 1,25(OH)2D in a patient with hypoparathyroidism. Milk-alkali syndrome was first described 70 years ago in the context of the treatment of peptic ulcer disease with large amounts of calcium and alkali. Although with current ulcer therapy (H-2 blockers, omeprazole, and sucralfate), the frequency of milk-alkali syndrome has decreased significantly, the classic triad of hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal impairment remains the hallmark of the syndrome. Milk-alkali syndrome can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. This article presents a patient with hypoparathyroidism who was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol resulting in two admissions to the hospital for milk-alkali syndrome. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous pamidronate on his first admission and with hydrocortisone on the second.

"Genetic separation of tumor growth and hemorrhagic phenotypes in an estrogen-induced tumor. Chronic administration of estrogen to the Fischer 344 (F344) rat induces growth of large, hemorrhagic pituitary tumors. Ten weeks of diethylstilbestrol (DES) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109.2 +/- 6.3 mg (mean +/- SE) versus 11.3 +/- 1.4 mg for untreated rats, and to become highly hemorrhagic. The same DES treatment produced no significant growth (8.9 +/- 0.5 mg for treated females versus 8.7 +/- 1.1 for untreated females) or morphological changes in Brown Norway (BN) rat pituitaries. An F1 hybrid of F344 and BN exhibited significant pituitary growth after 10 weeks of DES treatment with an average mass of 26.3 +/- 0.7 mg compared with 8.6 +/- 0.9 mg for untreated rats. Surprisingly, the F1 hybrid tumors were not hemorrhagic and had hemoglobin content and outward appearance identical to that of BN. Expression of both growth and morphological changes is due to multiple genes. However, while DES-induced pituitary growth exhibited quantitative, additive inheritance, the hemorrhagic phenotype exhibited recessive, epistatic inheritance. Only 5 of the 160 F2 pituitaries exhibited the hemorrhagic phenotype; 36 of the 160 F2 pituitaries were in the F344 range of mass, but 31 of these were not hemorrhagic, indicating that the hemorrhagic phenotype is not merely a consequence of extensive growth.

"Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic bladder irritation. Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. Chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chronic CYP administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG. A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG. Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.",cyclophosphamide ; cyp @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Effects of a new calcium antagonist, CD-832, on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis. Effects of CD-832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of CD-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion. Both CD-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion. In contrast to nifedipine, CD-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (P < .01) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. Diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (P < .05) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. These data show that CD-832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD-832.",isoproterenol ; iso @CHEMICAL@ myocardial ischemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats. We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk. Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. In rats with PAN nephropathy, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA. In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors. We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.",puromycin aminonucleoside ; pan @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy ; glomerular disease ; glomerulopathy ; renal disease ; glomerular hypertrophy ; tubulointerstitial damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Nefiracetam (DM-9384) reverses apomorphine-induced amnesia of a passive avoidance response: delayed emergence of the memory retention effects. Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative which attenuates scopolamine-induced learning and post-training consolidation deficits. Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism. A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation. Co-administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10h thereafter produced no significant anti-amnesic effect. However, administration of nefiracetam during training completely reversed the amnesia induced by apomorphine at the 10h post-training time and the converse was also true. These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism as nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace either [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]spiperone binding from D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively. It is suggested that nefiracetam augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to consolidation of memory.",apomorphine @CHEMICAL@ amnesia @DISEASE@ @CID@ scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ learning and post-training consolidation deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Human corticotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone modulate the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans. Human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) are known to stimulate ventilation after i.v. administration in humans. In a placebo-controlled, single-blind study we aimed to clarify if both peptides act by altering central chemosensitivity. Two subsequent CO2-rebreathing tests were performed in healthy young volunteers. During the first test 0.9% NaCl was given i.v.; during the second test 200 micrograms of hCRH (n = 12) or 400 micrograms of TRH (n = 6) was administered i.v. Nine subjects received 0.9% NaCl i.v. during both rebreathing manoeuvres. The CO2-response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject. In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the CO2-response curve to the left was observed after hCRH (P < 0.01). The same effect occurred following TRH but was less striking (P = 0.05). hCRH and TRH caused a reduction in the CO2 threshold. The CO2-response curves in the control group were nearly identical. The results indicate an additive effect of both releasing hormones on the hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans, presumably independent of central chemosensitivity.",co2 @CHEMICAL@ hypercapnic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Lamivudine is effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus DNA in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen carriers: a placebo-controlled trial. Lamivudine is a novel 2',3'-dideoxy cytosine analogue that has potent inhibitory effects on hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in vivo. We performed a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess its effectiveness and safety in Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Forty-two Chinese HBsAg carriers were randomized to receive placebo (6 patients) or lamivudine orally in dosages of 25 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg daily (12 patients for each dosage). The drug was given for 4 weeks. The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment. All 36 patients receiving lamivudine had a decrease in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA values of >90% (P < .001 compared with placebo). Although 25 mg of lamivudine was slightly less effective than 100 mg (P = .011) and 300 mg (P = .005), it still induced 94% suppression of HBV DNA after the fourth week of therapy. HBV DNA values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of cessation of therapy. There was no change in the hepatitis B e antigen status or in aminotransferase levels. No serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, a 4-week course of lamivudine was safe and effective in suppression of HBV DNA in Chinese HBsAg carriers. The suppression was >90% but reversible. Studies with long-term lamivudine administration should be performed to determine if prolonged suppression of HBV DNA can be achieved.",hepatitis b surface antigen ; hbsag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Population-based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives. BACKGROUND: Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) containing the third-generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second-generation progestagens. However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings. The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies. METHODS: We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK. The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981. All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE. We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. In the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs. We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease. FINDINGS: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen-only OCs. Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep-vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified. The crude rate of VTE per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any OC, 3.10 in users of second-generation OCs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations. After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third-generation relative to second-generation OCs was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.75). Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third-generation and second-generation OCs. Among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol. With all second-generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens. INTERPRETATION: The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation OCs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age. The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.",oral contraceptives ; ocs ; oc @CHEMICAL@ venous thromboembolism ; vte @DISEASE@ @CID@
"MK-801 augments pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure but protects against brain damage in rats. 1. The authors examined the anticonvulsant effects of MK-801 on the pilocarpine-induced seizure model. Intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) induced tonic and clonic seizure. Scopolamine (10 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (5 mg/kg) prevented development of pilocarpine-induced behavioral seizure but MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) did not. 2. An electrical seizure measured with hippocampal EEG appeared in the pilocarpine-treated group. Scopolamine and pentobarbital blocked the pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizure, MK-801 treatment augmented the electrographic seizure induced by pilocarpine. 3. Brain damage was assessed by examining the hippocampus microscopically. Pilocarpine produced neuronal death in the hippocampus, which showed pyknotic changes. Pentobarbital, scopolamine and MK-801 protected the brain damage by pilocarpine, though in the MK-801-treated group, the pyramidal cells of hippocampus appeared darker than normal. In all treatments, granule cells of the dentate gyrus were not affected. 4. These results indicate that status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine is initiated by cholinergic overstimulation and propagated by glutamatergic transmission, the elevation of which may cause brain damage through an excitatory NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism.",mk-801 @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; tonic and clonic seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizure ; tonic and clonic seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ neuronal death @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and folinic acid in metastatic breast cancer: BRE-26, a phase II trial. 5-Fluorouracil plus folinic acid and paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) are effective salvage therapies for metastatic breast cancer patients. Paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil have additive cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell lines. We performed a phase II trial of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours on day I followed by folinic acid 300 mg over 1 hour before 5-fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 every 28 days (TFL) in women with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis is reported on 37 patients with a minimum of 6 months follow-up who received a total of 192 cycles of TFL: nine cycles (5%) were associated with grade 3/4 neutropenia requiring hospitalization; seven (4%) cycles in two patients required granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to neutropenia; no patient required platelet transfusions. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were uncommon. Among the 34 patients evaluable for response, there were three complete responses (9%) and 18 partial responses (53%) for an overall response rate of 62%. Of the 19 evaluable patients with prior doxorubicin exposure, 11 (58%) responded compared with nine of 15 (60%) without prior doxorubicin.

"Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.","d,l-sotalol @CHEMICAL@ torsades de pointes @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Chronic hyperprolactinemia and changes in dopamine neurons. The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) system is known to inhibit prolactin (PRL) secretion. In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity. However, this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels. The purpose of this study was to induce hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain. Hyperprolactinemia was induced by treatment with haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and Palkovits' microdissection technique in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain. After 6 months of hyperprolactinemia, dopamine (DA) concentrations in the median eminence (ME) increased by 84% over the control group. Nine months of hyperprolactinemia produced a 50% increase in DA concentrations in the ME over the control group. However, DA response was lost if a 9-month long haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia was followed by a 1 1/2 month-long extremely high increase in serum PRL levels produced by implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule. There was no change in the levels of DA, norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), or their metabolites in the arcuate nucleus (AN), medial preoptic area (MPA), caudate putamen (CP), substantia nigra (SN), and zona incerta (ZI), except for a decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the AN after 6-months of hyperprolactinemia and an increase in DA concentrations in the AN after 9-months of hyperprolactinemia. These results demonstrate that hyperprolactinemia specifically affects TIDA neurons and these effects vary, depending on the duration and intensity of hyperprolactinemia. The age-related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function may be associated with increases in PRL secretion.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ hyperprolactinemia @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia during all-trans-retinoic acid therapy. A case of acute renal failure, due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and tranexamic acid has been described recently. We report a case of acute renal failure in an APL patient treated with ATRA alone. This case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with ATRA therapy in APL patients. The patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of APL and was included in a treatment protocol with ATRA. After 10 days of treatment, he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of APL was achieved and therapy discontinued. We conclude that ATRA is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with APL, although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected.

Pupillometric changes while on DEP, especially changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation, were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become manic. The large changes in total power of pupillary oscillation occurred a few days before the patient became fully manic.

"The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs. For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms. METHODS: According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen. Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1). Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli. Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales. RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions. Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID. The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.",ibuprofen @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans. BACKGROUND: In dogs, a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure. This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients (14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline (n=10, control subjects) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg/min (n=10). No variable changed with saline. With cocaine, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 (mean+/-SD) mg/L, similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication. Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV end-systolic volume, as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance.",cocaine ; cocaine hydrochloride @CHEMICAL@ deterioration of left ventricular (lv) systolic function ; deterioration of lv systolic and diastolic performance @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Pallidotomy with the gamma knife: a positive experience. 51 patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. In 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency (RF) method. Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively. Mean follow-up time is 20.6 months (range 6-48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year. 85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods. About 2/3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores. One patient in the Gamma Knife group (3.4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients (27.7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively. No other complications were seen. Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and methylphenidate. A 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. A relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective.

"Differential effects of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol on the neutral and acidic pathways of bile salt synthesis in the rat. Effects of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt (BS) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation and in rats with long-term bile diversion to induce BS synthesis. For this purpose, bile salt pool composition, synthesis of individual BS in vivo, hepatic activities, and expression levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A), and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), as well as of other enzymes involved in BS synthesis, were analyzed in rats treated with EE (5 mg/kg, 3 days) or its vehicle. BS pool size was decreased by 27% but total BS synthesis was not affected by EE in intact rats. Synthesis of cholate was reduced by 68% in EE-treated rats, while that of chenodeoxycholate was increased by 60%. The recently identified Delta22-isomer of beta-muricholate contributed for 5.4% and 18.3 % (P < 0.01) to the pool in control and EE-treated rats, respectively, but could not be detected in bile after exhaustion of the pool. A clear reduction of BS synthesis was found in bile-diverted rats treated with EE, yet biliary BS composition was only minimally affected. Activity of CYP7A was decreased by EE in both intact and bile-diverted rats, whereas the activity of the CYP27 was not affected. Hepatic mRNA levels of CYP7A were significantly reduced by EE in bile-diverted rats only; CYP27 mRNA levels were not affected by EE. In addition, mRNA levels of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase and lithocholate 6beta-hydroxylase were increased by bile diversion and suppressed by EE. This study shows that 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in rats is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt (BS) synthesis. Simultaneous impairment of other enzymes in the BS biosynthetic pathways may contribute to overall effects of EE on BS synthesis.",17alpha-ethinylestradiol ; ee @CHEMICAL@ intrahepatic cholestasis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Glibenclamide-sensitive hypotension produced by helodermin assessed in the rat. The effects of helodermin, a basic 35-amino acid peptide isolated from the venom of a lizard salivary gland, on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were examined in the rat, focusing on the possibility that activation of ATP sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels is involved in the responses. The results were also compared with those of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Helodermin produced hypotension in a dose-dependent manner with approximately similar potency and duration to VIP. Hypotension induced by both peptides was significantly attenuated by glibenclamide, which abolished a levcromakalim-produced decrease in arterial blood pressure. Oxyhemoglobin did not affect helodermin-induced hypotension, whereas it shortened the duration of acetylcholine (ACh)-produced hypotension. These findings suggest that helodermin-produced hypotension is partly attributable to the activation of glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channels), which presumably exist on arterial smooth muscle cells.

Thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin A therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker, sustained-release nifedipine, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs. Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin A therapy. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months. The adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin A and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patients. Our findings indicate that sustained-release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long-term treatment with cyclosporin A, but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia.",nifedipine @CHEMICAL@ gingival hyperplasia @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporin a @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; hypertensive @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclosporin a @CHEMICAL@ gingival hyperplasia @DISEASE@ @CID@

The authors describe the case of a 56-year-old woman with chronic, severe heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy and absence of significant ventricular arrhythmias who developed QT prolongation and torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during one cycle of intermittent low dose (2.5 mcg/kg per min) dobutamine. This report of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia during intermittent dobutamine supports the hypothesis that unpredictable fatal arrhythmias may occur even with low doses and in patients with no history of significant rhythm disturbances.

"Positive skin tests in late reactions to radiographic contrast media. In the last few years delayed reactions several hours after the injection of radiographic and contrast materials (PRC) have been described with increasing frequency. The authors report two observations on patients with delayed reactions in whom intradermoreactions (IDR) and patch tests to a series of ionic and non ionic PRC were studied. After angiography by the venous route in patient n degree 1 a biphasic reaction with an immediate reaction (dyspnea, loss of consciousness) and delayed macro-papular rash appeared, whilst patient n degree 2 developed a generalised sensation of heat, persistent pain at the site of injection immediately and a generalised macro-papular reaction after 24 hours. The skin tests revealed positive delayed reactions of 24 hours and 48 hours by IDR and patch tests to only some PRC with common chains in their structures. The positive skin tests are in favour of immunological reactions and may help in diagnosis of allergy in the patients.",contrast media ; contrast materials ; prc @CHEMICAL@ dyspnea @DISEASE@ @CID@ contrast media ; contrast materials ; prc @CHEMICAL@ loss of consciousness @DISEASE@ @CID@ contrast media ; contrast materials ; prc @CHEMICAL@ macro-papular rash @DISEASE@ @CID@ contrast media ; contrast materials ; prc @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection. From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.",5-fluorouracil ; 5-fu @CHEMICAL@ hyperammonemic ; hyperammonemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ 5-fluorouracil ; 5-fu @CHEMICAL@ encephalopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The effects of quinine and 4-aminopyridine on conditioned place preference and changes in motor activity induced by morphine in rats. 1. The effects of two unselective potassium (K(+)-) channel blockers, quinine (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) and 4-aminopyridine (1 and 2 mg/kg), on conditioned place preference and biphasic changes in motor activity induced by morphine (10 mg/kg) were tested in Wistar rats. Quinine is known to block voltage-, calcium- and ATP-sensitive K(+)-channels while 4-aminopyridine is known to block voltage-sensitive K(+)-channels. 2. In the counterbalanced method, quinine attenuated morphine-induced place preference, whereas 4-aminopyridine was ineffective. In the motor activity test measured with an Animex-activity meter neither of the K(+)-channel blockers affected morphine-induced hypoactivity, but both K(+)-channel blockers prevented morphine-induced secondary hyperactivity. 3. These results suggest the involvement of quinine-sensitive but not 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels in morphine reward. It is also suggested that the blockade of K(+)-channels sensitive to these blockers is not sufficient to prevent morphine-induced hypoactivity whereas morphine-induced hyperactivity seems to be connected to both quinine- and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive K(+)-channels.",morphine @CHEMICAL@ hyperactivity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin on learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in mice. 1. Nociceptin, also known as orphanin FQ, is an endogenous ligand for the orphan opioid receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1) and involves in various functions in the central nervous system (CNS). On the other hand, nocistatin is recently isolated from the same precursor as nociceptin and blocks nociceptin-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia. 2. Although ORL1 receptors which display a high degree of sequence homology with classical opioid receptors are abundant in the hippocampus, little is known regarding their role in learning and memory. 3. The present study was designed to investigate whether nociceptin/orphanin FQ and nocistatin could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, using spontaneous alternation of Y-maze and step-down type passive avoidance tasks in mice. 4. While nocistatin (0.5-5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.) administered 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, had no effect on spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance behaviours, a lower per cent alternation and shorter median step-down latency in the retention test were obtained in nociceptin (1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.)-treated normal mice. 5. Administration of nocistatin (1.5 and/or 5.0 nmol mouse-1, i.c.v.) 30 min before spontaneous alternation performance or the training session of the passive avoidance task, attenuated the scopolamine-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance behaviours. 6. These results indicated that nocistatin, a new biologically active peptide, ameliorates impairments of spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance induced by scopolamine, and suggested that these peptides play opposite roles in learning and memory.",scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ learning impairment ; impairment of learning @DISEASE@ @CID@ scopolamine @CHEMICAL@ memory impairment ; impairment of memory @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Induction of apoptosis by remoxipride metabolites in HL60 and CD34+/CD19- human bone marrow progenitor cells: potential relevance to remoxipride-induced aplastic anemia. The antipsychotic agent, remoxipride [(S)-(-)-3-bromo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenz amide] has been associated with acquired aplastic anemia. We have examined the ability of remoxipride, three pyrrolidine ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells. Cells were treated for 0-24 h with each compound (0-200 microM). Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in Hoechst 33342- and propidium iodide stained cell samples. Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells. The catechol and hydroquinone metabolites, NCQ436 and NCQ344, induced apoptosis in HL60 and HBMP cells in a time- and concentration dependent manner, while the phenols, NCR181, FLA873, and FLA797, and the derivatives formed by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring, FLA838, NCM001, and NCL118, had no effect. No necrosis was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types, inducing apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations. These data show that the catechol and hydroquinone metabolites of remoxipride have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells, leading to apoptosis, while the phenol metabolites were inactive. Similarly, benzene-derived catechol and hydroquinone, but not phenol, induce apoptosis in HBMP cells [Moran et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 50 (1996) 610-615]. We propose that remoxipride and benzene may induce aplastic anemia via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of NCQ436 and NCQ344 to induce apoptosis in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired aplastic anemia that has been associated with remoxipride.","remoxipride ; (s)-(-)-3-bromo-n-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenz amide @CHEMICAL@ aplastic anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ benzene @CHEMICAL@ aplastic anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Synthesis and preliminary pharmacological investigations of 1-(1,2-dihydro-2-acenaphthylenyl)piperazine derivatives as potential atypical antipsychotic agents in mice. In research towards the development of new atypical antipsychotic agents, one strategy is that the dopaminergic system can be modulated through manipulation of the serotonergic system.

Compound 7e, 5-{2-[4-(1,2-dihydro-2-acenaphthylenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl}-2,3-dihy dro-1H- indol-2-one, from this series showed significant affinities at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity at the D2 receptor. 7e exhibits a high reversal of catalepsy induced by haloperidol indicating its atypical antipsychotic nature.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Sub-chronic inhibition of nitric-oxide synthesis modifies haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NADPH-diaphorase neurons in mice. RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), induces catalepsy in mice. This effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic L-NOARG treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of subchronic L-NOARG treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with L-NOARG (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize NOS as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. RESULTS: L-NOARG sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of L-NOARG and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and L-NOARG-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.",haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs in patients with coronary artery disease after both dobutamine and exercise induced myocardial ischaemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise. DESIGN: A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia. SUBJECTS: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function. INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days. Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test. RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There was no difference in the maximum double product (p = 0.53) or ST depression (p = 0.63) with either form of stress. After exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline (mean (SEM), -5.6 (1.5)%, p < 0.05; and -6.1 (2.2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine (-10.8 (1.8)% and -5. 5 (1.8)%, both p < 0.01). Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise (-27.9 (7.2)% and -28.6 (5.7)%, both p < 0.01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine (-32 (5.3)%, p < 0.01). The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise. Dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with coronary artery disease.",dobutamine @CHEMICAL@ left ventricular dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@ dobutamine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial stunning @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Anorexigens and pulmonary hypertension in the United States: results from the surveillance of North American pulmonary hypertension. BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America. Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity. Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH. A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes (secondary pulmonary hypertension [SPH]). The use of anorexigens was common in both groups. However, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users. An unexpectedly high (11.4%) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the association with PPH, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH. The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH.",fenfluramine ; fenfluramines @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary hypertension ; primary pulmonary hypertension ; pph @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clinical aspects of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis and other side effects of heparin therapy. Heparin, first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro, has been clinically used to treat thrombosis for more than 50 years. Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development, heparin remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute thrombotic episodes. The clinical effects of heparin are meritorious, but side effects do exist. Bleeding is the primary untoward effect of heparin. Major bleeding is of primary concern in patients receiving heparin therapy. However, additional important untoward effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, heparin-associated osteoporosis, eosinophilia, skin reactions, allergic reactions other than thrombocytopenia, alopecia, transaminasemia, hyperkalemia, hypoaldosteronism, and priapism. These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual, but given the extremely widespread use of heparin, some are quite common, particularly HITT and osteoporosis. Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be ""softly"" deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated heparin, at present the incidences of these side effects with newer low molecular weight heparins appear to be much less common. However, only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations.",heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia ; hitt @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ osteoporosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ eosinophilia @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ skin reactions @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ allergic reactions @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ alopecia @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ hyperkalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ hypoaldosteronism @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin ; heparins @CHEMICAL@ priapism @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Hypercalcemia, arrhythmia, and mood stabilizers. Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia. A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1-year period was generated. After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions (group A) and 12 patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia (group B). Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies. Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age- and sex-comparable lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers. The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2. It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects. Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects. Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ hypercalcemia ; hypercalcemias @DISEASE@ @CID@

NS-718, a lipid nanosphere incorporating amphotericin B, is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low toxicity. We compared the toxicity of NS-718 with that of Fungizone (amphotericin B-sodium deoxycholate; D-AmB) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis, histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of amphotericin B following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats. Incubation with NS-718 resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with D-AmB. Serum blood urea and creatinine concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of D-AmB 3 mg/kg but not in those given the same dose of NS-718. Histopathological examination of the kidney showed tubular necrosis in D-AmB-treated rats but no change in NS-718-treated rats. Amphotericin B concentrations in the kidney in NS-718-treated rats were higher than those in D-AmB-treated rats.

"Hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone and amiodarone in animals with a healed myocardial infarction. The hemodynamic and antiadrenergic effects of dronedarone, a noniodinated compound structurally related to amiodarone, were compared with those of amiodarone after prolonged oral administration, both at rest and during sympathetic stimulation in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. All dogs (n = 6) randomly received orally dronedarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), amiodarone (10 and 30 mg/kg), and placebo twice daily for 7 days, with a 3-week washout between consecutive treatments. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MBP), positive rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (+LVdP/dt), echocardiographically assessed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening (FS), as well as chronotropic response to isoproterenol and exercise-induced sympathetic stimulation were evaluated under baseline and posttreatment conditions. Resting values of LVEF, FS, +LVdP/dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after dronedarone and to a lesser extent after amiodarone. Both dronedarone and amiodarone significantly reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia and, at the highest dose, decreased the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Thus, dronedarone and amiodarone displayed a similar level of antiadrenergic effect and did not impair the resting left ventricular function. Consequently, dronedarone might be particularly suitable for the treatment and prevention of various clinical arrhythmias, without compromising the left ventricular function.",isoproterenol @CHEMICAL@ tachycardia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Phase 2 trial of liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m(2)) in platinum/paclitaxel-refractory ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and primary carcinoma of the peritoneum. BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) to be an active antineoplastic agent in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with dose limiting toxicity of the standard dosing regimen (50 mg/m(2) q 4 weeks) being severe erythrodysesthesia (""hand-foot syndrome"") and stomatitis. We wished to develop a more tolerable liposomal doxorubicin treatment regimen and document its level of activity in a well-defined patient population with platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with ovarian or fallopian tube cancers or primary peritoneal carcinoma with platinum/paclitaxel-refractory disease (stable or progressive disease following treatment with these agents or previous objective response <3 months in duration) were treated with liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 40 mg/m(2) q 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (median age: 60; range 41-81) entered this phase 2 trial. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range: 1-6). Six (12%) and 4 (8%) patients experienced grade 2 hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis, respectively (no episodes of grade 3). One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea requiring hospitalization for hydration. Six (12%) individuals required dose reductions. The median number of courses of liposomal doxorubicin administered on this protocol was 2 (range: 1-12). Four of 44 patients (9%) evaluable for response exhibited objective and subjective evidence of an antineoplastic effect of therapy. CONCLUSION: This modified liposomal doxorubicin regimen results in less toxicity (stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome) than the standard FDA-approved dose schedule.

"Efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The Olanzipine HGGW Study Group. BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However, olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg, respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21 patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively).

"The effect of pupil dilation with tropicamide on vision and driving simulator performance. PURPOSE: To assess the effect of pupil dilation on vision and driving ability. METHODS: A series of tests on various parameters of visual function and driving simulator performance were performed on 12 healthy drivers, before and after pupil dilation using guttae tropicamide 1%. A driving simulator (Transport Research Laboratory) was used to measure reaction time (RT), speed maintenance and steering accuracy. Tests of basic visual function included high- and low-contrast visual acuity (HCVA and LCVA), Pelli-Robson contrast threshold (CT) and Goldmann perimetry (FIELDS). Useful Field of View (UFOV--a test of visual attention) was also undertaken. The mean differences in the pre- and post-dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95% level using one-tail paired t-tests. RESULTS: Pupillary dilation resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only. Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA, CT and RT. Little evidence emerged for deterioration in FIELDS and UFOV. Also, 7 of 12 drivers appeared to adjust their driving behaviour by reducing their speed on the driving simulator, leading to improved steering accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Pupillary dilation may lead to a decrease in vision and daylight driving performance in young people.

"Effect of methoxamine on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine stress incontinence: a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design was employed. Half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo (saline) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure (MUP), blood pressure, heart rate, and symptomatic side effects. Methoxamine evoked non-significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage. Systemic side effects including piloerection, headache, and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects. The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct, peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects.",methoxamine @CHEMICAL@ a significant rise in systolic blood pressure @DISEASE@ @CID@ methoxamine @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Toleration of high doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure: results from the ATLAS trial. The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival. BACKGROUND: Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses. The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose lisinopril in CHF. METHODS: The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium-dose lisinopril (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low-dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups. Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 (n = 3164) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months. We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4.2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension (2.0%) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (2.3%). Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study. Withdrawals occurred in 27.1% of the high- and 30.7% of the low-dose groups. Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; creatinine, > or =132.6 micromol/L [> or =1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or =70 years; and patients with diabetes) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with CHF can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.",lisinopril @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ lisinopril @CHEMICAL@ renal dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@ lisinopril @CHEMICAL@ hyperkalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cocaine, ethanol, and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse. OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually. In combination, these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone. Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to cocaethylene (CE), a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse. METHODS: Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (IV) boluses of cocaine 7.5 mg/kg with ethanol (1 g/kg) as an IV infusion (C+E, n = 8), 2) three cocaine boluses only (C, n = 6), 3) ethanol infusion only (E, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4). Hemodynamic measurements, electrocardiograms, and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline, and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered. RESULTS: Two of eight dogs in the C+E group experienced cardiovascular collapse. The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the C+E and C only groups; however, persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C+E group. Peak CE levels were associated with a 45% (SD +/- 22%, 95% CI = 22% to 69%) decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05), a 56% (SD +/- 23%, 95% CI = 32% to 80%) decrease in dP/dt(max) (p <.006), and a 23% (SD +/- 15%, 95% CI = 7% to 49%) decrease in SVO(2) (p < 0.025). Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the C+E group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone. Co-administration resulted in prolonged cardiac toxicity and was dysrhythmogenic.

"Frequency of appearance of myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) in Graves' disease patients treated with propylthiouracil and the relationship between MPO-ANCA and clinical manifestations. OBJECTIVE: Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped. Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy, or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated Graves' disease patients. Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves' disease. PATIENTS: We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease for the presence of MPO-ANCA, and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy. Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months. The remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation. The median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months). MEASUREMENTS: MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months. RESULTS: Before treatment, the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves' disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 U/ml). Three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of PTU therapy. In two of them, the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml, respectively, despite continued PTU therapy, but no vasculitic disorders developed. In the third patient, the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher fever, oral ulcers and polyarthralgia, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy, and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing PTU.

"Prevalence of heart disease in asymptomatic chronic cocaine users. To determine the prevalence of heart disease in outpatient young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users, 35 cocaine users and 32 age-matched controls underwent resting and exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and Doppler echocardiography. Findings consistent with coronary artery disease were detected in 12 (34%) patients and 3 (9%) controls (p = 0.01). Decreased left ventricular systolic function was demonstrated in 5 (14%) patients, but in none of the controls (p = 0.055). Finally, resting and peak exercise abnormal left ventricular filling was detected in 38 and 35% of patients as compared to 19 and 9% of controls, respectively (p = 0.11 and 0.02, respectively). We conclude that coronary artery or myocardial disease is common (38%) in young asymptomatic chronic cocaine users.

"Phase 2 early afterdepolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long-QT syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular wall. BACKGROUND: This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes (TdP) with QT prolongation induced by dl-sotalol and azimilide. The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations. dl-Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L), leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR. Azimilide, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L. Unlike dl-sotalol, azimilide (>3 micromol/L) increased epicardial APD markedly, causing a diminished TDR. Although both dl-sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen. An increase in TDR by dl-sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles. Of note, although azimilide (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than dl-sotalol, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation.",sotalol @CHEMICAL@ long-qt syndrome ; qt prolongation @DISEASE@ @CID@ sotalol @CHEMICAL@ torsade de pointes ; tdp @DISEASE@ @CID@
Prenatal cocaine exposure and cranial sonographic findings in preterm infants. PURPOSE: Prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with subependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term. We sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of subependymal cysts in preterm infants. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 premature (< 36 weeks of gestation) infants. Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine. Infants were assigned to the cocaine-exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery. RESULTS: Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories. The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% (16 of 117). The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with 8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally.

"Thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using electrodiagnostic studies. Sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer in an open-label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (NCS) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment. NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves. SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index. A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant. Thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response. Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months. Six patients developed neuropathy. Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently. Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors. Neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patients. The SNAP index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy, but not for early detection.",thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Overexpression of copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase protects from kanamycin-induced hearing loss. The participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside-iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ototoxicity in vivo. We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (h-SOD1) should protect transgenic mice from ototoxicity. Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h-SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL/6-TgN[SOD1]3Cje mice. Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received kanamycin (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth. Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth. In nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the kanamycin-treated group was 45-50 dB higher than in saline-injected controls. In the transgenic group, kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls. The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz. The protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention.",kanamycin @CHEMICAL@ hearing loss @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prednisone induces anxiety and glial cerebral changes in rats. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether prednisone (PDN) produces anxiety and/or cerebral glial changes in rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were studied and 3 groups were formed (8 rats per group). The moderate-dose group received 5 mg/kg/day PDN released from a subcutaneous implant. In the high-dose group, implants containing PDN equivalent to 60 mg/kg/day were applied. In the control group implants contained no PDN. Anxiety was assessed using an open field and elevated plus-maze devices. The number of cells and cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes and microglia cells were assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Anxiety was documented in both groups of PDN treated rats compared with controls. The magnitude of transformation of the microglia assessed by the number of intersections was significantly higher in the PDN groups than in controls in the prefrontal cortex (moderate-dose, 24.1; high-dose, 23.6; controls 18.7; p < 0.01) and striatum (moderate-dose 25.6; high-dose 26.3; controls 18.9; p < 0.01), but not in hippocampus. The number of stained microglia cells was significantly higher in the PDN treated groups in the prefrontal cortex than in controls (moderate-dose, 29.1; high-dose, 28.4; control, 17.7 cells per field; p < 0.01). Stained microglia cells were significantly more numerous striatum and hippocampus in the high-dose group compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Subacute exposure to PDN induced anxiety and reactivity of microglia. The relevance of these features for patients using PDN remains to be elucidated.",prednisone ; pdn @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. BACKGROUND: The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil; starting dose, 40 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity. The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks. The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients. Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients.

"Antimicrobial-induced mania (antibiomania): a review of spontaneous reports. The authors reviewed reported cases of antibiotic-induced manic episodes by means of a MEDLINE and PsychLit search for reports of antibiotic-induced mania. Unpublished reports were requested from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Twenty-one reports of antimicrobial-induced mania were found in the literature. There were 6 cases implicating clarithromycin, 13 implicating isoniazid, and 1 case each implicating erythromycin and amoxicillin. The WHO reported 82 cases. Of these, clarithromycin was implicated in 23 (27.6%) cases, ciprofloxacin in 12 (14.4%) cases, and ofloxacin in 10 (12%) cases. Cotrimoxazole, metronidazole, and erythromycin were involved in 15 reported manic episodes. Cases reported by the FDA showed clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin to be the most frequently associated with the development of mania. Statistical analysis of the data would not have demonstrated a significant statistical correlative risk and was therefore not undertaken. Patients have an increased risk of developing mania while being treated with antimicrobials. Although this is not a statistically significant risk, physicians must be aware of the effect and reversibility. Further research clearly is required to determine the incidence of antimicrobial-induced mania, the relative risk factors of developing an antimicrobial-induced manic episode among various demographic populations, and the incidence of patients who continue to have persistent affective disorders once the initial episode, which occurs while the patient is taking antibiotics, subsides.

"A comparison of glyceryl trinitrate with diclofenac for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea: an open, randomized, cross-over trial. Primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment. However, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor, in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac (DCF). A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles. In an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either DCF per os or GTN patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable. In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used. Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg DCF or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal GTN for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs. The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs. The difference in pain intensity score (DPI) was the main outcome variable. Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute (GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DCF, -18.9 +/- 16.6). However, DCF continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours, whereas GTN scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC (after one hour: GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DFC, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: GTN, -23.7 +/- 20.5; DFC, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001). Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs. Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF. Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache--attributed to its use--became intolerable. These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.",glyceryl trinitrate ; gtn @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, modulates glomerular injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) - induced nephrotic rats. Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four groups were used, i) the PAN group (14), ii) PAN/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). Temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN/temocapril group. Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. The glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group. There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the PAN group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the PAN/temocapril group.

"Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone reported with the use of Vincristine: an over-representation of Asians? PURPOSE: This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) among vincristine-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups. METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine. RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified. The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients. The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males. Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma. Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use.

"Delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mouse. The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice (DBA/2) but not in a resistant strain (C57BL/6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide (CY). Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy. Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days. After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of DBA/2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL/6 mice. Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium. Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA/2 mice than in C57BL/6 mice or untreated controls. Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells. Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers. Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA/2 mice 100 days after treatment. These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease.",cyclophosphamide ; cy @CHEMICAL@ haemorrhagic @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide ; cy @CHEMICAL@ cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"High-dose 5-fluorouracil / folinic acid in combination with three-weekly mitomycin C in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. A phase II study. BACKGROUND: The 24-hour continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FA) as part of several new multidrug chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) has shown to be effective, with low toxicity. In a previous phase II study with 3-weekly bolus 5-FU, FA and mitomycin C (MMC) we found a low toxicity rate and response rates comparable to those of regimens such as ELF, FAM or FAMTX, and a promising median overall survival. In order to improve this MMC-dependent schedule we initiated a phase II study with high-dose 5-FU/FA and 3-weekly bolus MMC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February, 1998 to September, 2000 we recruited 33 patients with AGC to receive weekly 24-hour 5-FU 2,600 mg/m(2) preceded by 2-hour FA 500 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Bolus MMC 10 mg/m(2) was added in 3-weekly intervals. Treatment given on an outpatient basis, using portable pump systems, was repeated on day 57. Patients' characteristics were: male/female ratio 20/13; median age 57 (27-75) years; median WHO status 1 (0-2). 18 patients had a primary AGC, and 15 showed a relapsed AGC. Median follow-up was 11.8 months (range of those surviving: 2.7-11.8 months). RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9.1% (n = 3), partial remission 45.5% (n = 15), no change 27.3% (n = 9), progressive disease 15.1% (n = 5). Median overall survival time was 10.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-11.6], and median progression-free survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.4-10.9). The worst toxicities (%) observed were (CTC-NCI 1/2/3): leukopenia 45.5/18.2/6.1, thrombocytopenia 33.3/9.1/6.1, vomitus 24.2/9.1/0, diarrhea 36.4/6.1/3.0, stomatitis 18.2/9.1/0, hand-foot syndrome 12.1/0/0. Two patients developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose 5-FU/FA/MMC is an effective and well-tolerated outpatient regimen for AGC (objective response rate 54.6%).

"Persistent sterile leukocyturia is associated with impaired renal function in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir. BACKGROUND: Prolonged administration of indinavir is associated with the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults. These well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children. DESIGN: A prospective study to monitor indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children treated with indinavir. METHODS: Urinary pH, albumin, creatinine, the presence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria and crystals, and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks. Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia (> or =75 cells/ micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits) after 96 weeks was 53%. Persistent sterile leukocyturia was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria. The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels >50% above normal was 33% after 96 weeks. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50% above normal than those children without persistent sterile leukocyturia. In children younger than 5.6 years, persistent sterile leukocyturia was significantly more frequent than in older children. A higher cumulative incidence of persistent leukocyturia was found in children with an area under the curve >19 mg/L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir >12 mg/L. In 4 children, indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity. Subsequently, the serum creatinine levels decreased, the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, and the leukocyturia disappeared within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile leukocyturia. Children with persistent sterile leukocyturia more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of >50% above normal. Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications. The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely, especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile leukocyturia, age <5.6 years, an area under the curve of indinavir >19 mg/L x h, and a C(max) >12 mg/L.",indinavir @CHEMICAL@ impaired renal function ; nephrotoxicity ; impairment of the renal function @DISEASE@ @CID@ indinavir @CHEMICAL@ hematuria @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Utility of troponin I in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for MI, and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both CK-MB MI and cTnI and were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for MI, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease. Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and suspected MI.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial infarction ; mi @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute interstitial nephritis due to nicergoline (Sermion). We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to nicergoline (Sermion). A 50-year-old patient admitted to our hospital for fever and acute renal failure. Before admission, he had been taking nicergoline and bendazac lysine due to retinal vein occlusion at ophthalmologic department. Thereafter, he experienced intermittent fever and skin rash. On admission, clinical symptoms (i.e. arthralgia and fever) and laboratory findings (i.e. eosinophilia and renal failure) suggested AIN, and which was confirmed by pathologic findings on renal biopsy. A lymphocyte transformation test demonstrated a positive result against nicergoline.

"Blood brain barrier in right- and left-pawed female rats assessed by a new staining method. The asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied in female rats. Paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test. Adrenaline-induced hypertension was used to destroy the BBB, which was evaluated using triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining of the brain slices just after giving adrenaline for 30 s. In normal rats, the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with TTC. After adrenaline infusion for 30 s, there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals, and vice versa in left-pawed animals. Similar results were obtained in seizure-induced breakdown of BBB. These results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats. It was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals.",adrenaline @CHEMICAL@ hypertension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose-limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin. Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties, protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity. Heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin (2 mg/kg sc/week), carvedilol (1 mg/kg ip/week), or the combination of the two drugs. Heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats. Mitochondrial calcium-loading capacity and the activity of NADH-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin-treated rats. Doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for liver mitochondria (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity. Coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver. Carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Ca(2+) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by doxorubicin. Carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondria. It is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long-term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients.",doxorubicin @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine-and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was examined in mice. All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent. It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction. Moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), A2A receptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), A1 receptor agonist, and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activity. CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals. These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity of animals. Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant. CPT (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test. Similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine-induced hyperactivity. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors (DMPX) and non-selective blockade of adenosine receptors (caffeine) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test. Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists (A1 and A2) reduce cocaine- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists (particularly A1 receptors) than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.","cocaine @CHEMICAL@ decreased the locomotor activity @DISEASE@ @CID@ amphetamine @CHEMICAL@ decreased the locomotor activity @DISEASE@ @CID@ dmpx ; 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine @CHEMICAL@ decreased the locomotor activity @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. BACKGROUND: Reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction (MI) between 1991 and 1999. Using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1:4) to 1,908 controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. RESULTS: amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 3.54). This effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (OR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.70 to 8.75 vs. OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.89). Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.31). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation.",amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ bradyarrhythmia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Indomethacin-induced morphologic changes in the rat urinary bladder epithelium. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the morphologic changes in rat urothelium induced by indomethacin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced cystitis is a poorly recognized and under-reported condition. In addition to tiaprofenic acid, indomethacin has been reported to be associated with this condition. METHODS: Three groups were established: a control group (n = 10), a high-dose group (n = 10), treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg/kg, and a therapeutic dose group (n = 10) in which oral indomethacin was administered 3.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 3 weeks. The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies. RESULTS: The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high-dose group. When compared with the control group, both indomethacin groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa (P <0.0001) and penetration of lanthanum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epithelium. Furthermore, the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant (P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Indomethacin resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial cystitis, such as leaky bladder epithelium and mucosal mastocytosis. The true incidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced cystitis in humans must be clarified by prospective clinical trials.",indomethacin @CHEMICAL@ interstitial cystitis @DISEASE@ @CID@ indomethacin @CHEMICAL@ mastocytosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"An open-label phase II study of low-dose thalidomide in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and haematological malignancies. Thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including bFGF, VEGF and IL-6. We undertook an open-label study using thalidomide 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. The mean time of study was 109 days (median 107, range 4-184 days). Patients underwent regular measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urea and electrolytes, serum bFGF and VEGF. Three men (15%) showed a decline in serum PSA of at least 50%, sustained throughout treatment. Of 16 men treated for at least 2 months, six (37.5%) showed a fall in absolute PSA by a median of 48%. Increasing levels of serum bFGF and VEGF were associated with progressive disease; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in PSA also showed a decline in bFGF and VEGF levels, and three of four men with a rising PSA showed an increase in both growth factors. Adverse effects included constipation, morning drowsiness, dizziness and rash, and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men. Evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was found in nine of 13 men before treatment. In the seven men who completed six months on thalidomide, subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found in four before treatment, but in all seven at repeat testing. The findings indicate that thalidomide may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy, provided close follow-up is maintained for development of peripheral neuropathy.",thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ constipation @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ drowsiness @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ dizziness @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ rash @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ peripheral sensory neuropathy ; peripheral neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Central nervous system toxicity following the administration of levobupivacaine for lumbar plexus block: A report of two cases. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia. Levobupivacaine, the pure S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine. We describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine. CASE REPORT: Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach. Immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 2.5 microgram/mL, the patients developed grand mal seizures, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration. The seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient. Neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity. Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions. Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients.",levobupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ grand mal seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@

Myotonia congenita (MC) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function, which may cause sustained membrane depolarisation. We describe a previously healthy 32-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening muscle spasm and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of suxamethonium. The muscle spasms disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further problems. When subsequently questioned, she reported minor symptoms suggesting a myotonic condition. Myotonia was found on clinical examination and EMG. The diagnosis MC was confirmed genetically.

"Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy. PURPOSE: Apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few. Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce. Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Twelve rats (six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions. Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph. This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) on a breath-by-breath basis. RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine-treated and control rats. Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals. The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE. In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group. Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined. We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy-associated conditions.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ epilepsy ; epileptic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure. METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001). Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E hepatitis (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01). There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients. A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.",paracetamol @CHEMICAL@ acute liver failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease. High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease. AIM: We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients. METHOD: Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in ""on"" and ""off"" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings. RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. The cognitive functions remained unchanged. Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. CONCLUSION: Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. It reduces the severity of ""off"" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesias ; akinesia ; drug-induced dyskinesias @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Ocular motility changes after subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. BACKGROUND: Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. CONCLUSIONS: Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. Subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.",carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ abnormal ocular motility @DISEASE@ @CID@ carboplatin @CHEMICAL@ fibrosis @DISEASE@ @CID@

METHOD: Thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome. RESULTS: All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug. Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking.

Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride, and the injection of botulinum toxin. Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate. All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis. After applying topical glycopyrrolate, the subjective effect was excellent (no sweating after eating hot spicy food) in 10 patients (77%), and fair (clearly reduced sweating) in 3 patients (23%). All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods. Adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients (2% glycopyrrolate), a light headache in 1 patient (1.5% glycopyrrolate). The topical application of a glycopyrrolate pad appeared to be safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyperhidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients, with few side effects.",glycopyrrolate @CHEMICAL@ sore throat @DISEASE@ @CID@ glycopyrrolate @CHEMICAL@ headache @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Pharmacological characteristics and side effects of a new galenic formulation of propofol without soyabean oil. We compared the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profile of a new galenic formulation of propofol (AM149 1%), which does not contain soyabean oil, with a standard formulation of propofol (Disoprivan 1%). In a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study, 30 healthy volunteers received a single intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol. Plasma propofol levels were measured for 48 h following drug administration and evaluated according to a three-compartment model. The pharmacodynamic parameters assessed included induction and emergence times, respiratory and cardiovascular effects, and pain on injection. Patients were monitored for side effects over 48 h. Owing to a high incidence of thrombophlebitis, the study was terminated prematurely and only the data of the two parallel treatment groups (15 patients in each group) were analysed. Plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between the two formulations. Anaesthesia induction and emergence times, respiratory and cardiovascular variables showed no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Pain on injection (80 vs. 20%, p < 0.01) and thrombophlebitis (93.3 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001) occurred more frequently with AM149 than with Disoprivan. Although both formulations had similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles the new formulation is not suitable for clinical use due to the high incidence of thrombophlebitis produced.",propofol ; disoprivan @CHEMICAL@ pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ propofol ; disoprivan @CHEMICAL@ thrombophlebitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Vinorelbine-related cardiac events: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine (VNR) have been reported in the literature. In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing VNR with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies. Randomized clinical trials comparing VNR with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in Medline, Embase, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002. Outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events, toxic deaths and cardiac event-related deaths reported in each publication. We found 19 trials, involving 2441 patients treated by VNR and 2050 control patients. The incidence of cardiac events with VNR was 1.19% [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.75; 1.67)]. There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between VNR and other drugs [odds ratio: 0.92, 95% CI (0.54; 1.55)]. The risk of VNR cardiac events was similar to vindesine (VDS) and other cardiotoxic drugs [fluorouracil, anthracyclines, gemcitabine (GEM) em leader ]. Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases, the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history, and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases. Vinorelbine-related cardiac events concern about 1% of treated patients in clinical trials. However, the risk associated with VNR seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications.",vinorelbine ; vnr @CHEMICAL@ cardiotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"MRI findings of hypoxic cortical laminar necrosis in a child with hemolytic anemia crisis. We present magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 5-year-old girl who had a rapidly installing hemolytic anemia crisis induced by trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole, resulting in cerebral anoxia leading to permanent damage. Magnetic Resonance imaging revealed cortical laminar necrosis in arterial border zones in both cerebral hemispheres, ischemic changes in subcortical white matter of left cerebral hemisphere, and in the left putamen. Although cortical laminar necrosis is a classic entity in adulthood related to conditions of energy depletions, there are few reports available in children.

"The natural history of Vigabatrin associated visual field defects in patients electing to continue their medication. PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have Vigabatrin-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control. METHODS: All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years (range 5-12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme. Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months (range 18-43 months). In all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication. Following already published methodology (Eye 2002; 16;567-571) monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36.98 degrees (range 22.25-51.0), compared to 38.40 degrees (range 22.5-49.75) after follow-up; P=0.338 unpaired t-test. Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication. These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Vigabatrin-associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent toxicity.",vigabatrin @CHEMICAL@ visual field defects ; visual field defect ; deterioration in visual field @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Induction of rosaceiform dermatitis during treatment of facial inflammatory dermatoses with tacrolimus ointment. BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti-inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face, and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid-aggravated rosacea and perioral dermatitis. We report on rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment. OBSERVATIONS: Six adult patients with inflammatory facial dermatoses were treated with tacrolimus ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments. Within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well-tolerated treatment, 3 patients with a history of rosacea and 1 with a history of acne experienced sudden worsening with pustular rosaceiform lesions. Biopsy revealed an abundance of Demodex mites in 2 of these patients. In 1 patient with eyelid eczema, rosaceiform periocular dermatitis gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treatment. In 1 patient with atopic dermatitis, telangiectatic and papular rosacea insidiously appeared after 5 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogeneous. A variety of factors, such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus, proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression, and the occlusive properties of the ointment, may be involved in the observed phenomena. Future studies are needed to identify individual risk factors.",tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ rosacea ; papular rosacea @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine. We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse. Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment. We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age-matched, healthy controls. Cortical maps revealed severe gray-matter deficits in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05). On average, MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter hypertrophy (7.0%; p < 0.01). Hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05). MRI-based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance. MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, neuropil reduction, or cell death. Prominent white-matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes, including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage. These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse, providing therapeutic targets for drug-induced brain injury.","methamphetamine ; ma @CHEMICAL@ structural deficits in the human brain ; abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles ; brain injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ methamphetamine ; ma @CHEMICAL@ impaired memory performance @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha target gene activation. Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation. Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose. Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport. Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [PPARalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene. Compared to wild-type mice, treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss. The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect. Based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect. These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.",amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ hepatotoxicity ; hepatotoxic @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ hepatomegaly @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety and compliance with once-daily niacin extended-release/lovastatin as initial therapy in the Impact of Medical Subspecialty on Patient Compliance to Treatment (IMPACT) study. Niacin extended-release/lovastatin is a new combination product approved for treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. This open-labeled, multicenter study evaluated the safety of bedtime niacin extended-release/lovastatin when dosed as initial therapy and patient compliance to treatment in various clinical practice settings. A total of 4,499 patients with dyslipidemia requiring drug intervention was enrolled at 1,081 sites. Patients were treated with 1 tablet (500 mg of niacin extended-release/20 mg of lovastatin) once nightly for 4 weeks and then 2 tablets for 8 weeks. Patients also received dietary counseling, educational materials, and reminders to call a toll-free number that provided further education about dyslipidemia and niacin extended-release/lovastatin. Primary end points were study compliance, increases in liver transaminases to >3 times the upper limit of normal, and clinical myopathy. Final study status was available for 4,217 patients (94%). Compliance to niacin extended-release/lovastatin was 77%, with 3,245 patients completing the study. Patients in the southeast and those enrolled by endocrinologists had the lowest compliance and highest adverse event rates. Flushing was the most common adverse event, reported by 18% of patients and leading to discontinuation by 6%. Incidence of increased aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal was <0.3%. An increase of creatine phosphokinase to >5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.24% of patients, and no cases of drug-induced myopathy were observed.

Whilst using the device she gradually became anxious, the feeling worsening after each bolus. The diagnosis of droperidol-induced psychological disturbance was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear history. After she had received a total of only 0.9 mg droperidol, a syringe containing diamorphine only was substituted and her unease resolved completely.

"Accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus: a case study. This case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health history. The case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to a traumatic brain injury. The nursing staff, by reviewing the patient's health history with his family, discovered a history of polydipsia and long-standing lithium use. Lithium is implicated in drug-induced nephrogenic DI, and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital, his treatment changed to focus on nephrogenic DI. By combining information from the patient history, the physical examination, and radiologic and laboratory studies, the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self-treating his lithium-induced nephrogenic DI and developed neurogenic DI secondary to brain trauma. Thus successful treatment required that nephrogenic and neurogenic DI be treated concomitantly.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ neurogenic diabetes insipidus ; nephrogenic di ; neurogenic di @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C produces hemolytic anemia. This study was conducted to identify the factors contributing to ribavirin-induced anemia. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with chronic hepatitis C who received interferon-alpha-2b at a dose of 6 MU administered intramuscularly for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin administered orally at a dose of 600 mg or 800 mg participated in the study. A hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL was defined as ribavirin-induced anemia. RESULTS: Ribavirin-induced anemia occurred in 18 (20.5%) patients during treatment. A 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentrations in patients with anemia was observed at week 2 after the start of treatment. The hemoglobin concentration in patients with > or =2 g/dL decrease at week 2 was observed to be significantly lower even after week 2 than in patients with <2 g/dL decrease (P < 0.01). A significant relationship was observed between the rate of reduction of hemoglobin concentrations at week 2 and the severity of anemia (P < 0.01). Such factors as sex (female), age (> or =60 years old), and the ribavirin dose by body weight (12 mg/kg or more) were significant by univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Careful administration is necessary in patients > or =60 years old, in female patients, and in patients receiving a ribavirin dose of 12 mg/kg or more.

"Oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac mitochondrial injury. The purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen species (RNS) reported to be present in adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiotoxicity actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage, and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach. B6C3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg ADR. Ultrastructural damage and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) were analyzed. Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle. Analysis of 4HNE protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4HNE protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3NT levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours. Our data showed ADR induced 4HNE-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when mitochondrial injury initially appeared. These results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage. The progressive nature of mitochondrial injury suggests that mitochondria, not other subcellular organelles, are the major site of intracellular injury.",adriamycin ; adr @CHEMICAL@ mitochondrial injury ; mitochondrial oxidative damage @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist, on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats. RATIONALE: 5-Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission. The antidepressant trazodone is a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system. METHODS: The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (WDS) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats. We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats. RESULTS: Trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections. Trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors. Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors. We suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.",apomorphine @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@ haloperidol @CHEMICAL@ catalepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Swallowing abnormalities and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. Gastrointestinal abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been known for almost two centuries, but many aspects concerning their pathophysiology have not been completely clarified. The aim of this study was to characterize the oropharyngeal dynamics in PD patients with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Fifteen dyskinetic, 12 nondyskinetic patients, and a control group were included. Patients were asked about dysphagia and evaluated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Parts II and III and the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Deglutition was assessed using modified barium swallow with videofluoroscopy. Nondyskinetic patients, but not the dyskinetic ones, showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency (OPSE) for liquid food than controls (Dunnett, P = 0.02). Dyskinetic patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nondyskinetic (Dunnett, P = 0.06). Patients who were using a higher dose of levodopa had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time (Pearson's correlation, P = 0.01 and 0.08, respectively). Neither the report of dysphagia nor any of the PD severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables. In the current study, dyskinetic patients performed better in swallowing function, which could be explained on the basis of a greater levodopa dose. Our results suggest a role for levodopa in the oral phase of deglutition and confirm that dysphagia is not a good predictor of deglutition alterations in PD.",levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesia ; dyskinetic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation attenuates tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by gentamicin. BACKGROUND: Animals treated with gentamicin can show residual areas of interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex. This study investigated the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and macrophages in the renal cortex and structural and functional renal changes of rats treated with gentamicin or gentamicin + pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB inhibitor. METHODS: 38 female Wistar rats were injected with gentamicin, 40 mg/kg, twice a day for 9 days, 38 with gentamicin + PDTC, and 28 with 0.15 M NaCl solution. The animals were killed 5 and 30 days after these injections and the kidneys were removed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. The results of the immunohistochemical studies were scored according to the extent of staining. The fractional interstitial area was determined by morphometry. RESULTS: Gentamicin-treated rats presented a transitory increase in plasma creatinine levels. Increased ED-1, MAP kinases and NF-kappaB staining were also observed in the renal cortex from all gentamicin-treated rats compared to control (p < 0.05). The animals killed on day 30 also presented fibrosis in the renal cortex despite the recovery of renal function. Treatment with PDTC reduced the functional and structural changes induced by gentamicin.

"Glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotic agents: a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis. BACKGROUND: While the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus may be increasing in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents, it remains unclear whether atypical agents are directly affecting glucose metabolism or simply increasing known risk factors for diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To study the 2 drugs most clearly implicated (clozapine and olanzapine) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design in stable, treated patients with schizophrenia evaluated using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and the Bergman minimal model analysis. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center. Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Thirty-six nonobese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, matched by body mass index and treated with either clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone, were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glucose effectiveness. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months (clozapine), 29.5 +/- 17.5 months (olanzapine), and 40.9 +/- 33.7 (risperidone). Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed among groups (F(33) = 3.35; P = .047) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.32; P = .03) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.15; P = .04). There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index among groups (F(33) = 10.66; P<.001) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone), with subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting significant insulin resistance compared with subjects who were treated with risperidone (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -4.29; P<.001; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -3.62; P = .001 [P<.001]). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly among groups (F(33) = 4.92; P = .01) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.94; P = .006; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.42; P = .02). There was a significant difference among groups in glucose effectiveness (F(30) = 4.18; P = .02) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.59; P = .02) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.34, P = .03).

"Focal cerebral ischemia in rats: effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension during reperfusion. After 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined. Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/hypertension (90/HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/hypertension (15/HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension. Part A, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry. Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye. Brain injury (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/HTN group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- SD) versus the 90/HTN group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5). Specific gravity was greater in the 15/HTN group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/HTN (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups. Evans Blue (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/HTN group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/HTN group (7.3 +/- 3.2).

There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%. CONCLUSION: The rate of major hemorrhage was high in this old, frail group, but excluding fatalities, resulted in no long-term sequelae, and the stroke rate on warfarin was low, demonstrating how effective warfarin treatment is.",warfarin @CHEMICAL@ hemorrhage ; bleeding ; hemorrhages @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Safety of celecoxib in patients with adverse skin reactions to acetaminophen (paracetamol) and nimesulide associated or not with common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (paracetamol--P) and Nimesulide (N) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs. The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low. On the contrary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly involved in such reactions. Celecoxib (CE) is a novel drug, with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and N associated or not to classic NSAIDs. METHODS: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs. The diagnosis of P and N-induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge. The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge. After three days, a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given. After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered. All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge, and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions. The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared: erythema, rush or urticaria-angioedema. RESULTS: No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated CE. Only one patient developed a moderate angioedema of the lips. CONCLUSION: Only one hypersensitivity reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and N-highly NSAIDs intolerant patients. Thus, we conclude that CE is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate P and N.",celecoxib ; ce @CHEMICAL@ angioedema @DISEASE@ @CID@ acetaminophen ; paracetamol ; p @CHEMICAL@ skin reactions ; cutaneous reactions @DISEASE@ @CID@ nimesulide ; n @CHEMICAL@ skin reactions ; cutaneous reactions @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and end-stage renal disease. BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long-term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have given conflicting results. In order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out. METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997. They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD. Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex. Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis. Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.89-1.66). For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for aspirin, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for pyrazolones, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for paracetamol, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs. The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)]. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long-term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD. However, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD.",aspirin @CHEMICAL@ end-stage renal disease ; esrd @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Growth-associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide. PURPOSE: GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in various experimental models of epilepsy. To investigate how GAP43 expression (GAP43-ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide (CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS. METHODS: CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats. The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX. Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX+Pilo, and control groups. However, the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that CHX+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the Pilo group. CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals. The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43.",pilocarpine ; pilo @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Nicotine antagonizes caffeine- but not pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiogenic effect in mice. RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide. Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently. Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice. The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety. METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) were given nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 min before caffeine (70 mg/kg i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) injections. After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open- and closed-arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10-min session. Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test. RESULTS: Nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas caffeine (70 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open-arm time and entry. Nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) pretreatment blocked the caffeine- but not pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiety. Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine-induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a non-specific anxiolytic effect. Thus, it may extend the current findings on the interaction between nicotine and caffeine.",caffeine @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@ pentylenetetrazole @CHEMICAL@ anxiety @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms. It has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women but the evidence supporting its use for these indications is largely observational. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, heart disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder disease, cognitive function, dementia, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT (oestrogens with or without progestogens) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included. Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently. They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after 3 years), breast cancer (after 5 years) and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease. Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long-term use. Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism. No trials focussed specifically on younger women. However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.",oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ cardiovascular disease @DISEASE@ @CID@ oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ dementia @DISEASE@ @CID@ oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ venous thromboembolism @DISEASE@ @CID@ oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ stroke @DISEASE@ @CID@ oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ breast cancer @DISEASE@ @CID@ oestrogens ; oestrogen @CHEMICAL@ gallbladder disease @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ cardiovascular disease @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ dementia @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ venous thromboembolism @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ stroke @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ breast cancer @DISEASE@ @CID@ progestogens @CHEMICAL@ gallbladder disease @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Drug-induced liver injury: an analysis of 461 incidences submitted to the Spanish registry over a 10-year period. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases. METHODS: A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of DILI following a prospective structured report form. The liver damage was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available. Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed. RESULTS: Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to DILI. The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, amoxicillin-clavulanate accounting for the 12.8% of the whole series. The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common (58%), was inversely correlated with age (P < .0001), and had the worst outcome (Cox regression, P < .034). Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and death in this group was 11.7% if patients had jaundice at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8% in nonjaundiced patients (P < .04). Factors associated with the development of fulminant hepatic failure were female sex (OR = 25; 95% CI: 4.1-151; P < .0001), hepatocellular damage (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 1.6-37; P < .009), and higher baseline plasma bilirubin value (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.22; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice have 11.7% chance of progressing to death or transplantation.

"In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: protection by erdosteine. The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM-induced renal impairment in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally. VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone. Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.",vancomycin ; vcm @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity ; renal impairment ; renal tubular injury ; kidney damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine-associated restless legs syndrome? There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome (RLS). For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms. To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS. Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy. Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS. However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with RLS in some individuals, especially those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.",mirtazapine @CHEMICAL@ restless legs syndrome ; rls @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Antiandrogenic therapy can cause coronary arterial disease. AIM: To study the change of lipid metabolism by antiandrogen therapy in patients with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied with a 2.5 years follow-up the changes in plasma cholesterols (C), triglycerides (TG), lipoproteins (LP), and apolipoproteins (Apo) B-100, A-I, and A-II pro fi les in 24 patients of mean age 60 years with low risk prostate cancer (stage: T1cN0M0, Gleason score: 2-5) during treatment with cyproterone acetate (CPA) without surgical management or radiation therapy. RESULTS: Significant decreases of HDL-C, Apo A-I and Apo A-II and an increase of triglyceride levels in VLDL were induced by CPA. After a period of 2.5 years on CPA treatment, four patients out of twenty-four were found to be affected by coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Ischaemic coronary arteriosclerosis with an incidence rate of 16.6% as caused by prolonged CPA therapy is mediated through changes in HDL cholesterol, Apo A-I and Apo A-II pro fi les, other than the well-known hyperglyceridemic effect caused by estrogen.",cyproterone acetate ; cpa @CHEMICAL@ coronary arterial disease ; coronary arteriosclerosis @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyproterone acetate ; cpa @CHEMICAL@ hyperglyceridemic effect @DISEASE@ @CID@
"5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine. Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies. We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU. As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL. The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.",5-fluorouracil ; 5-fu @CHEMICAL@ precordial pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ 5-fluorouracil ; 5-fu @CHEMICAL@ right bundle branch block @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. PURPOSE: Despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX. Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Because of the relatively short final half-life of monoHER (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect. METHODS: Six groups of 6 BALB/c mice were treated with saline, DOX alone or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. After a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed. Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham (in Cancer Treat Rep 62(6):865-872, 1978). Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group (P<0.001). RESULTS: The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% CI 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group. The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes. This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX.",doxorubicin ; dox @CHEMICAL@ cardiomyocyte damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clinical evaluation of adverse effects during bepridil administration for atrial fibrillation and flutter. BACKGROUND: Bepridil hydrochloride (Bpd) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). However, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes (Tdp), have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated. Bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (LAD) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively. Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months. There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each. In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation, Tdp occurred. The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate. There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age, which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp.

"Enhanced isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen. We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate. In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso). Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used. In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats. The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains. These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.",isoproterenol ; iso @CHEMICAL@ cardiac hypertrophy ; lv hypertrophy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Drug-induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone: high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors. BACKGROUND: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction. Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In the inpatient setting, the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment, its dose dependence, and the importance of cofactors such as drug-drug interactions remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a systematic, retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5-year period in a tertiary care hospital. A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone. In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, biological, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation. RESULTS: Among 167 methadone maintenance patients, the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0.50 second((1/2)) or longer was 16.2% compared with 0% in 80 control subjects. Six patients (3.6%) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes. QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P<.01). Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions, hypokalemia, and altered liver function. CONCLUSIONS: QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding. Methadone dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, potassium level, and liver function contribute to QT prolongation. Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone.",methadone @CHEMICAL@ long qt syndrome ; qt interval prolongation ; qt prolongation @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide (NO) deficiency: focus on venous function. Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity. These include augmented endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms. Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks. Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P<0.05). Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction. Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced (54% control). Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed. Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA. The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100, and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15, and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg). Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg). Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats. These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.",nitric oxide ; no @CHEMICAL@ hypertension ; hypertensive @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients. AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.",chlorpromazine @CHEMICAL@ extrapyramidal syndrome ; eps @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine-induced seizures in the rat. Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial. In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures. Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool. Thereafter, seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non-trained control groups. During the acute period of status epilepticus, we measured: (1) the latency of the first motor sign, (2) the intensity of seizures, (3) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period, and (4) the time when the acute period ended. All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects. Endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning. Administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients. Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved. We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning. Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine-receptor agonist pergolide (0.1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day. The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo. This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training. Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group. The extent of 'flattened' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition. These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals. Thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients.",pergolide @CHEMICAL@ impairs associative learning ; impaired novel word learning @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Minocycline-induced vasculitis fulfilling the criteria of polyarteritis nodosa. A 47-year-old man who had been taking minocycline for palmoplantar pustulosis developed fever, myalgias, polyneuropathy, and testicular pain, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Neither myeloperoxidase- nor proteinase-3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was positive. These manifestations met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa. Stopping minocycline led to amelioration of symptoms and normalization of CRP level. To our knowledge, this is the second case of minocycline-induced vasculitis satisfying the criteria. Differential diagnosis for drug-induced disease is invaluable even for patients with classical polyarteritis nodosa.",minocycline @CHEMICAL@ polyarteritis nodosa @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin combined with lamivudine in prevention of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation. BACKGROUND: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively. A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1% (4/7) and 62.5% (5/8) of HBV-DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative. Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.",hbeag @CHEMICAL@ hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Anticonvulsant effect of eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093) on seizures induced by microperfusion of picrotoxin in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in Phase III clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.",picrotoxin @CHEMICAL@ seizures ; seizure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing anthraquinones. Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions. Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids. We report a 23-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives, extracted from Rhizoma Rhei (rhubarb). The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis. Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later. Although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone-containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure.",chinese herbal ; chinese herbs @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure ; renal injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ diclofenac @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure ; renal injury @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Chloroacetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent: the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephropathy. Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with IFO. Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies. In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated. Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity. Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman. CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers. CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA. In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells. Thus, CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC. This effect can be reduced by acidification. Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.",ifosfamide ; ifo @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy ; renal damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the adult rat. Following status epilepticus in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation. It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus. However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis. To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox-1, a granule-cell-specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method. The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial, and stable over time. Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures. The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus. The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus @DISEASE@ @CID@ pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ temporal lobe epilepsy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A prospective, open-label trial of galantamine in autistic disorder. OBJECTIVE: Post-mortem studies have reported abnormalities of the cholinergic system in autism. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator, in the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism. METHODS: Thirteen medication-free children with autism (mean age, 8.8 +/- 3.5 years) participated in a 12-week, open-label trial of galantamine. Patients were rated monthly by parents on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, and by a physician using the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions scale. RESULTS: Patients showed a significant reduction in parent-rated irritability and social withdrawal on the ABC as well as significant improvements in emotional lability and inattention on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale--Revised. Similarly, clinician ratings showed reductions in the anger subscale of the Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale. Eight of 13 participants were rated as responders on the basis of their improvement scores on the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Overall, galantamine was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects apart from headaches in one patient. CONCLUSION: In this open trial, galantamine was well-tolerated and appeared to be beneficial for the treatment of interfering behaviors in children with autism, particularly aggression, behavioral dyscontrol, and inattention.

"Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia: 4-month outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: One hundred twelve subjects (70% male; mean age=23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with first-episode schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizoaffective disorder (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) or risperidone (1-6 mg/day). RESULTS: Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI=28.8%-58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI=39.9%-68.7%). Among those responding to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI=16.8%-65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI=0%-39.2%) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria. Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine. Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% CI=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% CI=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI=25.2-28.2) with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and response may be more stable. Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects.

"Early paracentral visual field loss in patients taking hydroxychloroquine. OBJECTIVE: To review the natural history and ocular and systemic adverse effects of patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate who attended an ophthalmic screening program. DESIGN: Retrospective study. RESULTS: Records of 262 patients who were taking hydroxychloroquine and screened in the Department of Ophthalmology were reviewed. Of the 262 patients, 14 (18%) of 76 who had stopped treatment at the time of the study experienced documented adverse effects. Systemic adverse effects occurred in 8 patients (10.5%) and ocular adverse effects, in 5 (6.5%). Thirty-five patients (13.4%) had visual field abnormalities, which were attributed to hydroxychloroquine treatment in 4 patients (1.5%). Three of the 4 patients were taking less than 6.5 mg/kg per day and all patients had normal renal and liver function test results. CONCLUSIONS: The current study used a protocol of visual acuity and color vision assessment, funduscopy, and Humphrey 10-2 visual field testing and shows that visual field defects appeared before any corresponding changes in any other tested clinical parameters; the defects were reproducible and the test parameters were reliable. Patients taking hydroxychloroquine can demonstrate a toxic reaction in the retina despite the absence of known risk factors.

"Peri-operative atrioventricular block as a result of chemotherapy with epirubicin and paclitaxel. A 47-year-old woman presented for mastectomy and immediate latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction having been diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast 6 months previously. In the preceding months she had received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin, paclitaxel (Taxol) and cyclophosphamide. This had been apparently uncomplicated and she had maintained a remarkably high level of physical activity. She was found to be bradycardic at pre-operative assessment but had no cardiac symptoms. Second degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block was diagnosed on electrocardiogram, and temporary transvenous ventricular pacing instituted in the peri-operative period. We discuss how evidence-based guidelines would not have been helpful in this case, and how chemotherapy can exhibit substantial cardiotoxicity that may develop over many years. We suggest that patients who have received chemotherapy at any time should have a pre-operative electrocardiogram even if they are asymptomatic.",epirubicin @CHEMICAL@ atrioventricular block @DISEASE@ @CID@ paclitaxel ; taxol @CHEMICAL@ atrioventricular block @DISEASE@ @CID@ cyclophosphamide @CHEMICAL@ atrioventricular block @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Risks and benefits of COX-2 inhibitors vs non-selective NSAIDs: does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit? A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective (NS) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs and acetaminophen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999-2002. Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to acetaminophen. Among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for AMI/GI vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). CONCLUSION: Among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic.",cox-2 inhibitors @CHEMICAL@ acute myocardial infarction ; ami @DISEASE@ @CID@ non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs @CHEMICAL@ acute myocardial infarction ; ami @DISEASE@ @CID@ non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs @CHEMICAL@ gi bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@ rofecoxib @CHEMICAL@ acute myocardial infarction ; ami @DISEASE@ @CID@ rofecoxib @CHEMICAL@ gi bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@ naproxen @CHEMICAL@ acute myocardial infarction ; ami @DISEASE@ @CID@ naproxen @CHEMICAL@ gi bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Quinine-induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria. It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while getting quinine infusion was reported. A man, 25 years old, was admitted to hospital with high fever, chill, vomiting, jaundice. The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 100 x/minute, regular. On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour. On the second day the patient had vomitus, diarrhea, tinnitus, loss of hearing. After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type--sinoatrial block, positive U wave. He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet. Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. He was discharged on 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC. Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-arrhythmic effect, especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases.",quinine @CHEMICAL@ premature ventricular contraction ; pvc @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Penicillamine-related lichenoid dermatitis and utility of zinc acetate in a Wilson disease patient with hepatic presentation, anxiety and SPECT abnormalities. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism with consequent copper accumulation and toxicity in many tissues and consequent hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric disorders. We report a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; moreover, in our patient, presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression, 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes, more marked on the left frontal lobe. During the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis, and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects. In our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson's disease patient in which penicillamine-related side effects appeared. The safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Since most of Wilson's disease penicillamine-treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion, it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response. Further studies are needed for a better clarification of Wilson's disease therapy, and in particular to differentiate specific therapies for different Wilson's disease phenotypes.",penicillamine @CHEMICAL@ lichenoid dermatitis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"A dramatic drop in blood pressure following prehospital GTN administration. A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep. The patient did not self medicate. The patient's observations were within normal limits, he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Several minutes after the GTN the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge. There was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to hospital. There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature. The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre.

"Comparison of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy at doses up to 320/25 mg versus monotherapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by long-term combination therapy in hypertensive adults. BACKGROUND: One third of patients treated for hypertension attain adequate blood pressure (BP) control, and multidrug regimens are often required. Given the lifelong nature of hypertension, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-hypertensive therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan (VAL) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: The first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial. Patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP [MSDBP], > or =95 mm Hg and <110 mm Hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg; VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo. Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point. VAL/HCTZ 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week, open-label extension. Response was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg or a > or =10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline. Control was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg compared with baseline. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry. RESULTS: A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg). All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (VAL and HCTZ, P < 0.001). Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001). The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo. The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg compared with VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002). Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL/HCTZ combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. The efficacy and tolerability of VAL/HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, combination therapies with VAL/HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.",hydrochlorothiazide ; hctz @CHEMICAL@ hypokalemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure. BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning. RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.","succimer @CHEMICAL@ cognitive impairment ; cognitive dysfunction ; cognitive deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@ lead ; pb @CHEMICAL@ impairments in learning @DISEASE@ @CID@ lead ; pb @CHEMICAL@ impairments in attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation @DISEASE@ @CID@"

Our aim was to observe if patients with panic disorder (PD) and patients with major depression with panic attacks (MDP) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) respond in a similar way to the induction of panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test. We randomly selected 29 patients with PD, 27 with MDP, 25 with major depression without panic attacks (MD), and 28 healthy volunteers. The patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4-week period. In a randomized double-blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg caffeine and a caffeine-free (placebo) solution were administered in a coffee form and anxiety scales were applied before and after each test. A total of 58.6% (n = 17) of patients with PD, 44.4% (n = 12) of patients with MDP, 12.0% (n = 3) of patients with MD, and 7.1% (n= 2) of control subjects had a panic attack after the 480-mg caffeine challenge test (chi(2)(3) = 16.22, P = .001). The patients with PD and MDP were more sensitive to caffeine than were patients with MD and healthy volunteers. No panic attack was observed after the caffeine-free solution intake. The patients with MD had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups (2-way analysis of variance, group by time interaction with Greenhouse-Geisser correction: F(3,762) = 2.85, P = .026). Our data suggest that there is an association between panic attacks, no matter if associated with PD or MDP, and hyperreactivity to an oral caffeine challenge test.",caffeine @CHEMICAL@ panic disorder ; panic attacks ; pd ; panic attack @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation (MR) since, as well as addressing the MR, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base. However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood. The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure. METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography. MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after MAP. RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively. Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg, p = 0.0480 and Tau (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045). After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and Emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml). CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR. However, further investigations are warranted in a model of chronic heart failure.",propranolol @CHEMICAL@ failing left ventricle ; heart failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Piperacillin/tazobactam-induced seizure rapidly reversed by high flux hemodialysis in a patient on peritoneal dialysis. Despite popular use of piperacillin, the dire neurotoxicity associated with piperacillin still goes unrecognized, leading to a delay in appropriate management. We report a 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), who developed slurred speech, tremor, bizarre behavior, progressive mental confusion, and 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) after 5 doses of piperacillin/tazobactam (2 g/250 mg) were given for bronchiectasis with secondary infection. The laboratory data revealed normal plasma electrolyte and ammonia levels but leukocytosis. Neurologic examinations showed dysarthria and bilateral Babinski sign. Computed tomography of brain and electroencephalogram were unremarkable. Despite the use of antiepileptic agents, another GTCS episode recurred after the sixth dose of piperacillin/tazobactam. Brain magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate acute infarction and organic brain lesions. Initiation of high-flux hemodialysis rapidly reversed the neurologic symptoms within 4 hours. Piperacillin-induced encephalopathy should be considered in any uremic patients with unexplained neurological manifestations.

"Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.",prilocaine @CHEMICAL@ vocal cord paralysis ; vocal nerve palsies @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia. Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation. This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses. Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin. Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group. There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups. These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.","bcnu ; carmustine ; 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure @CHEMICAL@ cortical dysplasia @DISEASE@ @CID@"
Myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) synthase inhibition: in-vivo study in rats. Lithium and valproate are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets. Both drugs influence inositol metabolism. Lithium inhibits IMPase and valproate inhibits MIP synthase. This study shows that MIP synthase inhibition does not replicate or augment the effects of lithium in the inositol sensitive pilocarpine-induced seizures model. This lack of effects may stem from the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular inositol supply or to the inhibition of the de-novo synthesis by lithium itself.,pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-associated acute interstitial nephritis with granular tubular basement membrane deposits. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (ATIN) is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from a variety of insults, including immune complex-mediated tubulo-interstitial injury, but drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a far more frequent cause. Overall, as an entity, ATIN remains under-diagnosed, as symptoms resolve spontaneously if the medication is stopped. We report on a 14-year-old boy who developed acute renal failure 2 weeks after aortic valve surgery. He was put on aspirin following surgery and took ibuprofen for fever for nearly a week prior to presentation. He then presented to the emergency department feeling quite ill and was found to have a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration of of 147 mg/dl, creatinine of 15.3 mg/dl and serum potassium of 8.7 mEq/l. Dialysis was immediately initiated. A kidney biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate consistent with ATIN. However, in the tubular basement membrane (TBM), very intense granular deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3 were noted. He needed dialysis for 2 weeks and was treated successfully with steroids for 6 months. His renal recovery and disappearance of proteinuria took a year. In conclusion, this is a first report of NSAIDs-associated ATIN, showing deposits of granular immune complex present only in the TBM and not in the glomeruli.",ibuprofen @CHEMICAL@ interstitial nephritis ; tubulo-interstitial injury @DISEASE@ @CID@ ibuprofen @CHEMICAL@ acute renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated Iranian patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. BACKGROUND: Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants (resistant hepatitis B virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants. All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l, respectively. HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti-HBe in 60% of the patients. Anti-HCV was negative in all of them. YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe. CONCLUSION: Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported, these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients.",hbeag @CHEMICAL@ chronic hepatitis b virus infection ; chronic hepatitis b @DISEASE@ @CID@

"The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release, cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model. BACKGROUND: In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites, long-acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation. In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects. METHODS: Subjects (n = 114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery. After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) measurements. RESULTS: The bupivacaine/rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, as assessed by a visual analog scale, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h. However, the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups. Moreover, bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine/placebo group. Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ inflammation @DISEASE@ @CID@ bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ postoperative pain @DISEASE@ @CID@
"p75NTR expression in rat urinary bladder sensory neurons and spinal cord with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis. A role for nerve growth factor (NGF) in contributing to increased voiding frequency and altered sensation from the urinary bladder has been suggested. Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks) in micturition reflexes with urinary bladder inflammation. The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF, p75(NTR), after various durations of bladder inflammation induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP). CYP-induced cystitis increased (P < or = 0.001) p75(NTR) expression in the superficial lateral and medial dorsal horn in L1-L2 and L6-S1 spinal segments. The number of p75(NTR)-immunoreactive (-IR) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) also increased (P < or = 0.05) with CYP-induced cystitis (acute, intermediate, and chronic). Quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated significant increases (P < or = 0.01) in p75(NTR) mRNA in DRG with intermediate and chronic CYP-induced cystitis. Retrograde dye-tracing techniques with Fastblue were used to identify presumptive bladder afferent cells in the lumbosacral DRG. In bladder afferent cells in DRG, p75(NTR)-IR was also increased (P < or = 0.01) with cystitis. In addition to increases in p75(NTR)-IR in DRG cell bodies, increases (P < or = 0.001) in pericellular (encircling DRG cells) p75(NTR)-IR in DRG also increased. Confocal analyses demonstrated that pericellular p75(NTR)-IR was not colocalized with the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These studies demonstrate that p75(NTR) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by bladder inflammation. The functional significance of p75(NTR) expression in micturition reflexes remains to be determined.",cyclophosphamide ; cyp @CHEMICAL@ cystitis ; urinary bladder inflammation ; bladder inflammation @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Azathioprine-induced suicidal erythrocyte death. BACKGROUND: Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug. The side effects of azathioprine include anemia, which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression. Alternatively, anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage. METHODS: The present experiments explored whether azathioprine influences eryptosis. According to annexin V binding, erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine. In a second series, cytosolic Ca2+ activity (Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume (forward scatter), and PS-exposure (annexin V binding) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Exposure to azathioprine (> or =2 microg/mL) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter. The effect of azathioprine on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+. CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine triggers suicidal erythrocyte death, an effect presumably contributing to azathioprine-induced anemia.",azathioprine @CHEMICAL@ anemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Clinical comparison of cardiorespiratory effects during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. BACKGROUND: Spinal anaesthesia is widely employed in clinical practice but has the main drawback of post-spinal block hypotension. Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. RESULTS: Three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P= 0.71. Four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, P= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (P= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004). The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations. Also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.",bupivacaine @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Spectrum of adverse events after generic HAART in southern Indian HIV-infected patients. To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05).

"Thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity: a neurophysiological study. BACKGROUND: Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide. The study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed. Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy. RESULTS: During treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%). One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude. Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps. After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients. At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres. This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.",thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ sensory neurotoxicity ; sensory axonal neuropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ paresthesias @DISEASE@ @CID@ thalidomide @CHEMICAL@ cramps @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Amiodarone-related pulmonary mass and unique membranous glomerulonephritis in a patient with valvular heart disease: Diagnostic pitfall and new findings. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug for life-threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported. Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass (1.5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time. The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone-related lesion. In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass. In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like. Autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found. The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone-related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.",amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ pulmonary mass ; lung mass ; pulmonary lesion @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ membranous glomerulonephritis @DISEASE@ @CID@ amiodarone @CHEMICAL@ hemosiderin ; hemosiderotic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Risk of coronary artery disease associated with initial sulphonylurea treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a matched case-control study. AIMS: This study sought to assess the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) associated with initial treatment of type 2 diabetes with different sulphonylureas. METHODS: In type 2 diabetic patients, cases who developed CAD were compared retrospectively with controls that did not. The 20-year risk of CAD at diagnosis of diabetes, using the UKPDS risk engine, was used to match cases with controls. RESULTS: The 76 cases of CAD were compared with 152 controls. The hazard of developing CAD (95% CI) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold (1.3-4.3, P=0.004) with glibenclamide; 2-fold (0.9-4.6, P=0.099) with glipizide; 2.9-fold (1.6-5.1, P=0.000) with either, and was unchanged with metformin. The hazard decreased 0.3-fold (0.7-1.7, P=0.385) with glimepiride, 0.4-fold (0.7-1.3, P=0.192) with gliclazide, and 0.4-fold (0.7-1.1, P=0.09) with either. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment of type 2 diabetes with glibenclamide or glipizide is associated with increased risk of CAD in comparison to gliclazide or glimepiride. If confirmed, this may be important because most Indian patients receive the cheaper older sulphonylureas, and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents.",glibenclamide @CHEMICAL@ coronary artery disease ; cad @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reduced progression of adriamycin nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated by losartan. BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. METHODS: Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups. Two control groups (SH(6), SH(12)) received vehicle. Groups ADR(6), ADR+LOS(6) and ADR(12), and ADR+LOS(12) received ADR (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. Group ADR+LOS(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group ADR+LOS(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of ADR. Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. RESULTS: Short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. Prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR. Histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in ADR nephropathy.

"The risks of aprotinin and tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a one-year follow-up of 1188 consecutive patients. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort. METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic (n = 1188). During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin (Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid (Group T). Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged. RESULTS: The pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups. Postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in Group T (4.6% vs 1.2%, P < 0.001). This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups (7.9% vs 1.2%, P = 0.003; 7.3% vs 2.4%, P = 0.035, respectively). Persistent atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs 2.3%, P = 0.020) and renal failure (9.7% vs 1.7%, P = 0.002) were also more common in Group T, in the primary valve surgery subgroup. On the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in Group A (5.8% vs 2.0%, P = 0.027; 22.5% vs 15.2%, P = 0.036, respectively). The 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group (17.7% vs 9.8%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery. Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.",tranexamic acid @CHEMICAL@ seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@ tranexamic acid @CHEMICAL@ renal failure @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The biological properties of the optical isomers of propranolol and their effects on cardiac arrhythmias. 1. The optical isomers of propranolol have been compared for their beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities.2. In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, (+)-propranolol had less than one hundredth the potency of (-)-propranolol. At dose levels of (+)-propranolol which attenuated the responses to isoprenaline, there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.3. The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs (an increase in circulating glucose, lactate and free fatty acids) were all blocked by (-)-propranolol. (+)-Propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both lactate and glucose.4. Both isomers of propranolol possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea-pigs.5. The isomers of propranolol exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine. The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6. Both isomers of propranolol were capable of preventing adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias in cats anaesthetized with halothane, but the mean dose of (-)-propranolol was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg whereas that of (+)-propranolol was 4.2+/-1.2 mg/kg. At the effective dose level of (+)-propranolol there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram. Blockade of arrhythmias with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of adrenaline.7. Both isomers of propranolol were also capable of reversing ventricular tachycardia caused by ouabain in anaesthetized cats and dogs.

"Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy in unresectable glioblastoma: a phase 2 study. Improving glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge. Topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration. The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/40 days) and topotecan (0.9 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 on weeks 1, 3 and 5) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated GBM. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities was low and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients (mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia). Partial response and stabilization rates were 2% and 32%, respectively, with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks. One-year overall survival (OS) rate was 42%, with a median OS of 40 weeks. Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy was well tolerated. However, while response and stabilization concerned one-third of the patients, the study did not show increased benefits in terms of survival in patients with unresectable GBM.",topotecan @CHEMICAL@ lymphopenia @DISEASE@ @CID@ topotecan @CHEMICAL@ neutropenia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Long-term lithium therapy leading to hyperparathyroidism: a case report. PURPOSE: This paper reviews the effect of chronic lithium therapy on serum calcium level and parathyroid glands, its pathogenesis, and treatment options. We examined the case of a lithium-treated patient who had recurrent hypercalcemia to better understand the disease process. CONCLUSION: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of long-term lithium therapy. Careful patient selection and long-term follow-up can reduce morbidity. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: As much as 15% of lithium-treated patients become hypercalcemic. By routinely monitoring serum calcium levels, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life of this patient group.",lithium @CHEMICAL@ hyperparathyroidism @DISEASE@ @CID@ lithium @CHEMICAL@ hypercalcemia ; hypercalcemic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions, including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure, during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway (FRLMA) versus endotracheal tube (ETT) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol-remifentanil total i.v. anesthesia (TIVA). METHODS: Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol-remifentanil-TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups: group I, FRLMA; group II, ETT. Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six-point scale. RESULTS: Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS.",propofol @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@ remifentanil @CHEMICAL@ hypotension @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease during valproate therapy. Valproic acid (VPA) is effective for the treatment of many types of epilepsy, but its use can be associated with an increase in body weight. We report a case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) arising in a child who developed obesity during VPA treatment. Laboratory data revealed hyperinsulinemia with insulin resistance. After the withdrawal of VPA therapy, our patient showed a significant weight loss, a decrease of body mass index, and normalization of metabolic and endocrine parameters; moreover, ultrasound measurements showed a complete normalization. The present case suggests that obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and long-term treatment with VPA may be all associated with the development of NAFLD; this side effect is reversible after VPA withdrawal.",valproate ; valproic acid ; vpa @CHEMICAL@ nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ; nafld @DISEASE@ @CID@ valproate ; valproic acid ; vpa @CHEMICAL@ obesity @DISEASE@ @CID@ valproate ; valproic acid ; vpa @CHEMICAL@ hyperinsulinemia @DISEASE@ @CID@ valproate ; valproic acid ; vpa @CHEMICAL@ insulin resistance @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. PURPOSE: To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes? DATA EXTRACTION: All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased. LIMITATIONS: New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability. CONCLUSION: Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.",aspirin @CHEMICAL@ strokes ; stroke @DISEASE@ @CID@ aspirin @CHEMICAL@ gastrointestinal bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@ aspirin @CHEMICAL@ hemorrhagic @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation: practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized, direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT. The US FDA-recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg/kg/min (reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) 1.5-3 times baseline (not >100 seconds). Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion, e.g. heart failure, yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity. Argatroban 0.5-1.2 microg/kg/min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs. The FDA-recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg/kg/min (350 microg/kg initial bolus), adjusted to achieve activated clotting times (ACTs) of 300-450 sec. For PCI, argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity, and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio, and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban-to-warfarin transition should be followed. Major bleeding with argatroban is 0-10% in the non-interventional setting and 0-5.8% periprocedurally. Argatroban has no specific antidote, and if excessive anticoagulation occurs, argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced. Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT, including in special populations and during PCI, may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT (e.g. fewer thromboses) or its treatment (e.g. fewer argatroban medication errors).",argatroban @CHEMICAL@ bleeding @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Rhabdomyolysis and brain ischemic stroke in a heroin-dependent male under methadone maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: There are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. Methadone may aggravate this problem. METHOD: A clinical case description. RESULTS: A 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. He had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. In the ICU, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. After transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. After MRI, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. CONCLUSION: Those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. Patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events.

"Increased vulnerability to 6-hydroxydopamine lesion and reduced development of dyskinesias in mice lacking CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Motor impairment, dopamine (DA) neuronal activity and proenkephalin (PENK) gene expression in the caudate-putamen (CPu) were measured in 6-OHDA-lesioned and treated (L-DOPA+benserazide) CB1 KO and WT mice. A lesion induced by 6-OHDA produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of DA neurons and increased PENK gene expression in the CPu. Oxidative/nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex (Cg). CB1 KO mice exhibited higher MDA levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Cg compared to WT mice. Treatment with L-DOPA+benserazide (12 weeks) resulted in less severe dyskinesias in CB1 KO than in WT mice. The results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid CB1 receptors increased the severity of motor impairment and DA lesion, and reduced L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. These results suggest that activation of CB1 receptors offers neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion and the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias.",l-dopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesias @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Animal model of mania induced by ouabain: Evidence of oxidative stress in submitochondrial particles of the rat brain. The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ouabain (a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar mania. Clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of ouabain in rats. To achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)M) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test. Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. Our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10(-2) and 10(-3)M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection. In addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala. In conclusion, ouabain-induced mania-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder.",ouabain @CHEMICAL@ mania ; bipolar mania ; bipolar disorder @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Intraoperative dialysis during liver transplantation with citrate dialysate. Liver transplantation for acutely ill patients with fulminant liver failure carries high intraoperative and immediate postoperative risks. These are increased with the presence of concomitant acute kidney injury (AKI) and intraoperative dialysis is sometimes required to allow the transplant to proceed. The derangements in the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways during fulminant liver failure can lead to difficulties with anticoagulation during dialysis, especially when continued in the operating room. Systemic anticoagulation is unsafe and regional citrate anticoagulation in the absence of a functional liver carries the risk of citrate toxicity. Citrate dialysate, a new dialysate with citric acid can be used for anticoagulation in patients who cannot tolerate heparin or regional citrate. We report a case of a 40-year-old female with acetaminophen-induced fulminant liver failure with associated AKI who underwent intraoperative dialytic support during liver transplantation anticoagulated with citrate dialysate during the entire procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any signs of citrate toxicity and maintained adequate anticoagulation for patency of the dialysis circuit.

"Delirium in a patient with toxic flecainide plasma concentrations: the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of flecainide-induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with paroxetine. CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L (reference range 200-1000). A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Her delirium resolved 3 days later. DISCUSSION: Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a CYP2D6 substrate, and paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. According to the Naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. Because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors.",flecainide @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@ paroxetine @CHEMICAL@ delirium @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Efficacy of everolimus (RAD001) in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors. BACKGROUND: Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RAD001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was overall response rate (ORR). Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. ORR was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2). Overall disease control rate was 47.1%. Median progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). Common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%. Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS. CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC.

"Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a ""rule out acute coronary syndrome"" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 +/- 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score <2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis >or=50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0-6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score <2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ chest pain @DISEASE@ @CID@ cocaine @CHEMICAL@ myocardial ischemia @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant. OBJECTIVES: Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents (primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown. CASE: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant. After an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma. RESULTS: Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions. Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation. The termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is rare. We recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction.",tacrolimus @CHEMICAL@ posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ; posterior leukoencephalopathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Prolonged hypothermia as a bridge to recovery for cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension associated with fulminant hepatic failure. BACKGROUND: To review evidence-based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia. METHOD: Case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema. RESULTS: Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period. The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission. Initial evaluation confirmed FHF from acetaminophen and cerebral edema. The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy, hyperventilation, sedation, and chemical paralysis. Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy. We then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days. At re-warming, patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. At discharge, she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions.

"Binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin. This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (VGB). Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy (current, previous, or no exposure to VGB). Groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB, 43% of patients who previously took VGB, and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current VGB users and 22% of prior VGB users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB. Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history.

"Smoking of crack cocaine as a risk factor for HIV infection among people who use injection drugs. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection. Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection. METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit. To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996-Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999-Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002-Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3). RESULTS: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study. Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up. The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06-7.11). INTERPRETATION: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users.

"Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil. Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition. A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function. In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain. In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine. In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic (two week) treatment with 5-FU and (three weeks) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats. Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test (CER) which showed that animals treated with 5-FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls. A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test (OLR). Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance. 5-FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls. This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5-FU. Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour. These findings suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.",5-fluorouracil ; 5-fu @CHEMICAL@ memory deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration. We have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling via elimination of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver regeneration. This study investigates the role of ILK in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital (PB). Wild-type (WT) and ILK:liver-/- mice were given PB (0.1% in drinking water) for 10 days. Livers were harvested on 2, 5, and 10 days during PB administration. In the hepatocyte-specific ILK/liver-/- mice, the liver:body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 (2.5 times), while at days 5 and 10, it was enlarged three times. In the WT mice, the increase was as expected from previous literature (1.8 times) and seems to have leveled off after day 2. There were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the ILK/liver-/- animals at day 2 as compared to WT after PB administration. In the WT animals, the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10. Hepatocytes of the ILK/liver-/- mice continued to proliferate up until day 10. ILK/liver-/- mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during PB administration. In summary, ECM proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via ILK to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative response. Lack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.",phenobarbital ; pb @CHEMICAL@ hepatomegaly @DISEASE@ @CID@

Sprague-Dawley male rats (200~250 g) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin (100 mg/kg per day) for 7 days, and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined. Gentamicin-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels. Accordingly, the fractional excretion of sodium increased. Urine volume was increased, while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, and AQP1 in the kidney of gentamicin-treated rats. The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased. Gentamicin-induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1 and OAT.",gentamicin @CHEMICAL@ nephropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Longitudinal association of alcohol use with HIV disease progression and psychological health of women with HIV. We evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on HIV disease progression among women with HIV. The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression. Our findings have implications for the provision of alcohol use interventions and psychological resources to improve the health of women with HIV.",alcohol @CHEMICAL@ depression @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies. In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection. METHODS: SE was induced by pilocarpine injection. Control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses. The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus. CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay. RESULTS: Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE. Seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2. Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following SE. Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells in SE rats. In addition, rats that experienced SE exhibited CCR2-labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus. These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats. Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following SE. CONCLUSION: The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced SE. Seizures also result in changes to CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes. These changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.",pilocarpine @CHEMICAL@ status epilepticus ; se @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Metallothionein induction reduces caspase-3 activity and TNFalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine-treated rats. Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions. On the other hand, induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO(4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented. The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent (i.v). The second group administered ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v, once) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 h. Third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v). Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. ZnSO(4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3. The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO(4) + BCNU compared to only BCNU-treated animals. In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.",carmustine ; bcnu @CHEMICAL@ cognitive dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@ carmustine ; bcnu @CHEMICAL@ deterioration of learning @DISEASE@ @CID@ carmustine ; bcnu @CHEMICAL@ deterioration of short-term memory @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Fatal carbamazepine induced fulminant eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis: emphasis on anatomical and histological characteristics, mechanisms and genetics of drug hypersensitivity and differential diagnosis. The most severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine have been observed in the haemopoietic system, the liver and the cardiovascular system. A frequently fatal, although exceptionally rare side effect of carbamazepine is necrotizing eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis. We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine. Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made post-mortem. Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage. Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock.

"Neuropsychiatric behaviors in the MPTP marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are increasingly recognised as a significant problem in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms may be due to 'sensitisation' following repeated levodopa treatment or a direct effect of dopamine on the disease state. The levodopa-treated MPTP-lesioned marmoset was used as a model of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients. Here we compare the time course of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors to determine the relationship between duration of treatment and onset of symptoms. METHODS: Marmosets were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2.0 mg/kg s.c.) for five days, resulting in stable parkinsonism. Levodopa (15 mg/kg and benserazide, 3.75 mg/kg) p.o. b.i.d, was administered for 30 days. Animals were evaluated for parkinsonian disability, dyskinesia and on-time (motor fluctuations) and neuropsychiatric-like behaviors on Day 0 (prior to levodopa) and on Days 1, 7, 13, 27 and 30 of treatment using post hoc DVD analysis by a trained rater, blind to the treatment day. RESULTS: The neuropsychiatric-like behavior rating scale demonstrated high interrater reliability between three trained raters of differing professional backgrounds. As anticipated, animals exhibited a progressive increase in levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and wearing-off, that correlated with the duration of levodopa therapy. In contrast, levodopa-induced neuropsychiatric-like behaviors were present on Day 1 of levodopa treatment and their severity did not correlate with duration of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that neuropsychiatric disorders in PD are more likely an interaction between levodopa and the disease state than a consequence of sensitisation to repeated dopaminergic therapy.","mptp ; 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine @CHEMICAL@ parkinsonian disability @DISEASE@ @CID@ levodopa @CHEMICAL@ dyskinesia @DISEASE@ @CID@"
"Contrast medium nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium (CM) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (PTRA). PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA (PTRA group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02). Changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014). This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients. The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by CM toxicity.",contrast medium ; cm @CHEMICAL@ nephrotoxicity ; renal dysfunction ; nephrotoxic ; renal damage @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: a case-control study. BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the UK. Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence. AIMS AND METHODS: We compared the severity of pretransplant illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) emergently between 1999-2004 for acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=36) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=35) and elective LT for chronic liver disease (CLD, n=34). RESULTS: Acetaminophen-induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre-LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups. Twenty (56%) acetaminophen-induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT (non-acetaminophen-induced ALF=0/35, CLD=2/34; P<0.01 for all) and nine (25%) had a previous suicide attempt. During follow-up (median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection (acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups (acetaminophen-induced ALF 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non-acetaminophen-induced ALF 88%, 78%; CLD 93%, 82%: P>0.6 log rank). Two acetaminophen-induced ALF patients reattempted suicide post-LT (one died 8 years post-LT). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance, outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen-induced ALF were comparable to those transplanted for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF and electively for CLD. Multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance.",acetaminophen @CHEMICAL@ acute liver failure ; alf @DISEASE@ @CID@ acetaminophen @CHEMICAL@ hepatotoxicity @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker, CNSB002, in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of CNSB002, a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and CNSB002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models: carrageenan-induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy. RESULTS: The maximum nonsedating doses were: morphine, 3.2 mg/kg; CNSB002 10.0 mg/kg; 5.0 mg/kg CNSB002 with morphine 3.2 mg/kg in combination. The doses calculated to cause 50% reversal of hyperalgesia (ED50) were 7.54 (1.81) and 4.83 (1.54) in the carrageenan model and 44.18 (1.37) and 9.14 (1.24) in the STZ-induced neuropathy model for CNSB002 and morphine, respectively (mg/kg; mean, SEM). These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses. The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 (5 mg/kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0.56 (1.55) in the carrageenan model and 1.37 (1.23) in the neuropathy model (mg/kg; mean, SEM). The antinociception after morphine (3.2 mg/kg) was increased by co-administration with CNSB002 from 28.0 and 31.7% to 114.6 and 56.9% reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models, respectively (P < 0.01; one-way analysis of variance-significantly greater than either drug given alone).

"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a practical review. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains under-recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes. It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles. Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT, with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications. The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups, with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations. HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure. Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes. The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor. Current ""diagnostic"" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT. Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment. Direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate, evidence-based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of HIT, who need to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure, a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated.",heparin @CHEMICAL@ thrombocytopenia ; hit @DISEASE@ @CID@ heparin @CHEMICAL@ thrombosis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Abductor paralysis after botox injection for adductor spasmodic dysphonia. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the thyroarytenoid muscles are the current standard of care for adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD). Reported adverse effects include a period of breathiness, throat pain, and difficulty with swallowing liquids. Here we report multiple cases of bilateral abductor paralysis following Botox injections for ADSD, a complication previously unreported. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Patients that received Botox injections for spasmodic dysphonia between January 2000 and October 2009 were evaluated. Patients with ADSD were identified. The number of treatments received and adverse effects were noted. For patients with bilateral abductor paralysis, age, sex, paralytic Botox dose, prior Botox dose, and course following paralysis were noted. RESULTS: From a database of 452 patients receiving Botox, 352 patients had been diagnosed with ADSD. Of these 352 patients, eight patients suffered bilateral abductor paralysis, and two suffered this complication twice. All affected patients were females over the age of 50 years. Most patients had received treatments prior to abductor paralysis and continued receiving after paralysis. Seven patients recovered after a brief period of activity restrictions, and one underwent a tracheotomy. The incidence of abductor paralysis after Botox injection for ADSD was 0.34%. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral abductor paralysis is a rare complication of Botox injections for ADSD, causing difficulty with breathing upon exertion. The likely mechanism of paralysis is diffusion of Botox around the muscular process of the arytenoid to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The paralysis is temporary, and watchful waiting with restriction of activity is the recommended management.",botox @CHEMICAL@ adductor spasmodic dysphonia ; adsd @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Mitochondrial impairment contributes to cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction: Prevention by the targeted antioxidant MitoQ. The goal of this study was to assess mitochondrial function and ROS production in an experimental model of cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that cocaine abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause left ventricular dysfunction. Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers, specifically through complex I and complex III. ROS levels were increased, specifically in interfibrillar mitochondria. In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis, whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria. This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short-term exposure to cocaine, suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine. MitoQ, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, was shown to completely prevent these mitochondrial abnormalities as well as cardiac dysfunction characterized here by a diastolic dysfunction studied with a conductance catheter to obtain pressure-volume data. Taken together, these results extend previous studies and demonstrate that cocaine-induced cardiac dysfunction may be due to a mitochondrial defect.",cocaine @CHEMICAL@ cardiac dysfunction @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Trimethoprim-induced immune hemolytic anemia in a pediatric oncology patient presenting as an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. A 10-year-old male with acute leukemia presented with post-chemotherapy anemia. During red cell transfusion, he developed hemoglobinuria. Transfusion reaction workup was negative. Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia was suspected because of positive direct antiglobulin test, negative eluate, and microspherocytes on smear pre- and post-transfusion. Drug studies using the indirect antiglobulin test were strongly positive with trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but negative with sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered after discontinuing the drug, with no recurrence in 2 years. Other causes of anemia should be considered in patients with worse-than-expected anemia after chemotherapy.

"Blockade of endothelial-mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. OBJECTIVE: A multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy (diabetic nephropathy). We have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndoMT) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In the present study, we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line (MMEC) in the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP by administration of AGEs, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control. Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3) were performed in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.",streptozotocin ; stz @CHEMICAL@ diabetic nephropathy @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor. However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor.Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months. In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy. Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression. Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy. Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.",temsirolimus @CHEMICAL@ necrotic @DISEASE@ @CID@

"Diffuse skeletal pain after administration of alendronate. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation, and bisphosphonates, are used to inhibit bone resorption. Alendronate, a biphosphonate, is effective for both the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Side effects are relatively few and prominently gastrointestinal. Musculoskeletal pain may be an important side effect in these patients. We presented a patient admitted to our out-patient clinic with diffuse skeletal pain after three consecutive administration of alendronate.

"Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph. Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4. On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission). The patient's Glasgow Coma Score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16. Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL, respectively, prior to the third dose. Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.",nafcillin @CHEMICAL@ interstitial nephritis @DISEASE@ @CID@
"The role of nitric oxide in convulsions induced by lindane in rats. Lindane is an organochloride pesticide and scabicide. It evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of GABA(A) receptors. Nitric oxide (NO), gaseous neurotransmitter, has contradictor role in epileptogenesis due to opposite effects of L-arginine, precursor of NO syntheses (NOS), and L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) observed in different epilepsy models. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of NO on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of lindane-induced epilepsy in male Wistar albino rats. The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with L-NAME. These results support the conclusion that NO plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of lindane seizures.",lindane @CHEMICAL@ convulsions ; convulsion ; convulsive ; seizures @DISEASE@ @CID@
"Long-term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male Wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin. Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor (IR) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter GLUT4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells. An alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the C-4-epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway. Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested. We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose (200 mg/kg/day) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced (STZ-icv) rat model of sAD, tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test, respectively. One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the STZ-icv administration, successfully prevented development of the STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficits. Beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. Additionally, oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood. The increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose. Oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD.",galactose ; d-galactose @CHEMICAL@ cognitive deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin ; stz @CHEMICAL@ cognitive deficits @DISEASE@ @CID@ streptozotocin ; stz @CHEMICAL@ alzheimer's disease ; ad @DISEASE@ @CID@ glucose ; d-glucose @CHEMICAL@ alzheimer's disease ; ad @DISEASE@ @CID@
